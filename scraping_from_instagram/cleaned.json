The quiet process of precisely cutting produce and meticulously laying out new designs was therapeutic--a meditative and restorative space for focus.  Over time, as this undertaking has evolved into a professional pursuit and this platform has grown to a size impossible for me to comprehend, making my art and sharing it so publicly has felt increasingly fraught. As a reserved, sensitive introvert, Ive struggled with navigating life as a public personality and coping with the more abrasive and harmful aspects of social media.  After a continuous decline in my mental health and thanks to people in my community who candidly answered all my questions and connected me with resources, I finally mustered up the nerve to seek professional support. The weekly sessions have been immediately challenging and healing. Because friends, family, and acquaintances discussing and normalizing therapy was so critical for me, I hope that sharing my own experience will also serve as an endorsement for seeking the support you need to ensure your health in all ways.  Shared in partnership with A Mindful State, a collaboration devoted to the individual and collective well-being of Washingtonians. More information and resources available in the link in my bio.

(Like babka but not quite as rich)  When I made my first successful loaf of homemade cheese bread, I knew the recipe would be an instant hit with readers. After publishing it a few years ago, its consistently been the most popular bread recipe on this website. What could be better than cheese and homemade bread? Well well well...  Readers asked if they can use the same dough to make a sweet version, so I tweaked the recipe and swapped cheese for butter, brown sugar, and cinnamon. Then I topped the whole thing with a cinnamon crunch topping. (Ever have a Panera Bread cinnamon crunch bagel? Like that!) Talk about an upgrade!  Each bite is buttery, soft, and flaky with an unbelievable cinnamon sugar crunch on top. Its shaped like our Nutella Babka, but the dough isnt as heavy.

Keep your eyes peeled theyre more common than you think. You can also purchase them online. Can I do this with another type of freeze-dried fruit? Yes, absolutely. I've tested this sugar cookie dough with freeze-dried strawberries, blueberries, and mango. Can I do this with regular dried fruit or frozen fruit? No, do not use chewy/gummy dried fruit and do not use frozen fruit. You need freeze-dried raspberries, which are raspberries with all of the moisture removed-- that way they can grind into a powder. https://sallysbakingaddiction.com/raspberry-sugar-cookies/",

Are you proud of me?? When we got hit with the pandemic last year and everyone was living in fear and anxiety I asked myself what can I do to serve the world? What if 2020 is my last year of living? I told myself lets just leave everything behind and give everything I got whatever that meant First, I shared authentic recipes cuz thats what I knew Then, I realized people wanted EASY & ACCESSIBLE recipes they can cook at home since they were stuck at home and going out to the market was kinda scary just a year ago. so I came up with Broke Boyz recipes And people also told me my videos brought them JOY while stuck at home feeling anxious watching all the crazy news thats going on in the world so I made the videos more fun & entertaining. So I focused on delivery AUTHENTIC, EASY, FUN videos. What a crazy 13 months I hope yall proud of ya bul!! I aint sign no deal and kept it Philly ALLLL THE WAY!! Sometimes you might see me doing couple brand deals here and there. Hope ya support me through it cuz I need to pay the bills too ya mean?? Here what I wrote a year ago Thank you for the 20k follow!! I really appreciate the love & support~  Im just a kid who loves Korean food & Philly and Imma rep it ALLLL THE WAY UP  #philly #koreafood May 14, 2020 Again, thanks for allowing to be me and giving me the courage to keep doing what I do.

Just sayin!!! ;) Spicy Skinny LALO Margarita Serves 2 4 oz LALO Tequila  large jalapeno, seeds removed and thinly sliced 2 oz lime juice 1 oz fresh-squeezed orange juice  oz honey 1 tsp egg white Salt, for serving Lime wedges, for serving In a cocktail shaker, add the sliced jalapeno and lime juice. With a cocktail muddler or back end of a wooden spoon, break up the jalapeno. Next, add the freshly squeezed orange juice, honey, tequila and egg white to the shaker then dry shake (aka, no ice).  Salt your glasses then add ice. Pour your margarita, serve with a lime wedge and enjoy!!  #nationaltequiladay",

An easy #ddsimplesummer dinner that I thoroughly enjoyed  For the Salad: 8 thin slices of coppa (can sub prosciutto or salami) 3 cups baby arugula, packed 1 cup hulled and sliced strawberries  cup halved and thinly sliced red onion (or  large onion)  jalapeno, seeds removed and very thinly sliced  cup thinly sliced basil leaves  For the Dressing: 2 tbsp evoo 2 cloves garlic, minced 1 tbsp balsamic vinegar 1 tbsp fresh lemon juice  tsp Dijon mustard For the Scallops: 1 lb. sea scallops 1 tsp. Kosher Salt   tsp black pepper 2 tbsp evoo Method: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Place the coppa on a large baking sheet in a single layer so that none of the coppa is touching. When the oven is hot, bake until the coppa is just crisp, about 6 minutes. Set aside to let cool.  Meanwhile, prepare your salad. In a large bowl, combine the arugula, strawberries, red onion, and basil. Set aside.  In a small bowl, whisk together the olive oil, garlic, balsamic, lemon and Dijon until well combined.  Pat the scallops very dry and season generously on both sides with kosher salt and pepper. Heat the EVOO in a large skillet over medium-high heat. When just starting to smoke, carefully place the scallops in the hot skillet and cook, undisturbed, until bottom has developed a golden crust, 2 to 3 minutes. Flip and cook until golden on the other side, 2 to 3 more minutes. Transfer to a plate and set aside.  Drizzle the dressing over the salad and toss to coat. Divide the salad amongst 2 plates and top with the seared scallops. Roughly chop the crisp coppa and sprinkle over the top of the scallops and salad.",

Sadly this isnt the case.  New ingredients are usually approved by the food manufacturer themselves, and NOT by the FDA.  All an ingredient manufacturer has to do is HIRE THEIR OWN EXPERTS to claim its safe. This is the green light to start adding it to food products. Several FDA Approved products have been yanked from the shelves after they were found to be downright dangerous.  But this doesnt happen overnight.  History shows that it takes YEARS before the FDA acts and removes harmful products from the market.  Something very serious needs to happen  like deaths  before the FDA takes action. And even then, they may not. Remember how Johnson & Johnsons talc powder was recently removed from the shelves after slews of cancer claims and cover-ups by the company? Well, the FDA didnt ban it.  J&J voluntarily decided to stop selling it to stop lawsuits from piling up. Meanwhile, this controversial ingredient is banned in Europe.  This just goes to show how little the FDA has done to protect our health.  Tag your friends below to spread the word!",

But the truth is Additives are added to almost every processed food - so you are likely eating SEVERAL of them at every meal and DOZENS of them in a day. This can add up very quickly! You might be eating Caramel Color (an ingredient linked to cancer) in your morning latte, breakfast oats, deli sandwich for lunch, and in the iced tea that washes it all down. Thats 4 doses of Caramel Color on a typical day. No one is evaluating whether this is safe. Not to mention how all of the different additives in your food may interact with each other in negative ways.

Its crucial to know the difference if you want to pick out the healthiest and safest food for you and your family. Heres what to remember: Organic food is non-GMO, but non-GMO food isnt necessarily organic. Lets break it down...  Non-GMO Project verifies that a product doesnt contain GMO ingredients. While that is good, its not the whole story about what the product contains, how it was produced, and where it came from.  USDA Organic regulations prohibit any GMO ingredients in a certified organic product.  Organic crops cannot be grown with synthetic pesticides. Non-GMO crops can be grown the same as conventional crops and can still be laden with toxic pesticide residue.  Glyphosate (Roundup) is prohibited on organic crops. Non-GMO crops (such as non-organic wheat and non-organic oats) can be sprayed pre-harvest with Roundup. This herbicide accumulates in your body the more you are exposed to it and is linked to cancer.  Organic ingredients arent processed with the neurotoxin hexane.  Organic crops are prohibited from being fertilized with sewage sludge (biosolids) which is literally the treated waste thats flushed down the toilet, and waste from hospitals and industry.  Organic meat isnt produced with growth-promoting drugs, like ractopamine.  Organic animals arent fattened up with growth-promoting antibiotics. Antibiotics have been used for years, not just to fight infection, but to fatten up farm animals. The overuse of growth-promoting antibiotics is creating superbugs that could threaten the entire human population. All of this is why the Non-GMO label is NOT enough! When I have a choice, I choose certified organic food for these reasons and more! Subscribe to learn the truth about your food: FoodBabe.com/subscribe",

When organic oats have been tested, there are negligible amounts of pesticides found in them compared to non-organic oats like Quaker.  Choose minimally processed oats. I eat organic steel cut oats for breakfast most mornings of the week. Its easy to prepare in my slow cooker (directions are in Food Babe Kitchen!) and you can add a variety of healthy toppings like berries, hemp seeds, and nut butter. Try organic oat groats. These are the truest form of oats and contain more vitamins, minerals and nutrients than steel cut, rolled or instant oats. They are available in most health food stores in the bulk section. I love to use these for overnight oats, since you need to soak your oat groats before eating or cooking them. How do you like to prepare your oats? Tell me in the comments below!

But when you need a store-bought alternative, here are some better options to replace Cheez-its made with TBHQ, Goldfish Crackers full of addicting ingredients, and processed Veggie Straws fried in unhealthy canola oil. These alternative snacks are easy to pack and dont contain white flour or white sugar, which are some of the most addicting and damaging ingredients in processed food.

The frozen yogurt from shops like Pinkberry, Menchies, and Yogurtland is a processed milk product mixed with some kind of refined sweetener  usually white sugar, corn syrup, or dextrose, blended with natural or artificial flavorings, natural or artificial colors, stabilizers and thickeners like carrageenan other fillers like soy lecithin or cellulose gum (a.k.a. the stuff made from wood pulp).  Swipe left to see a comparison!  Before the mixture is frozen into an edible product, the yogurt ingredients come in a big box of pre-made liquid or powder. This is very similar to how most fast food franchises obtain their products  in a box or a carton pre-made, pre-mixed, heavily processed and preserved.  To witness just how processed frozen yogurt can be, I challenge you to go over to your favorite frozen yogurt joint and ask them to show you themselves. Youll see it looks NOTHING like yogurt and more like kool-aid, depending on the flavor. Its a rather disgusting sight to tell you the truth, and an exercise I conduct on occasion to remind myself not to eat that stuff. Tag your friends below to share the truth!

And its not all that tricky - the line between the black and white is created using baking paper to stop the colour going over the line. And you do need to flip the whole cake over for the anti gravity drips, but once its been in the freezer for a bit, its easy!! The cake isnt going anywhere! Like my other books, there are a selection of tasty cake recipes from red velvet to apple cake to creme brulee cake (including vegan and gluten free options!) that will work with this design, so you can pick your favourite. And just like before too, there arent just cakes - theres bread, pastries, mousses, smaller bakes, biscuits, all sorts...! More to come soon. I have actually received the ACTUAL BOOK in the post the other day and resisted opening it so far as been thinking of doing an Instagram live for the first unwrapping, what do you think? Would you tune in? Ive always had a bit of a mental block with Instagram lives cause of anxieties , but I want to do it, Im gonna do it!!!!  .

Excitement cause Im super proud and these are all good things! And then nervous because Im thinking what your reaction is going to be, all the scary what ifs, and cause Im often not living in the moment - instead thinking of the NEXT THING when I take a break.  Like a lot of us, I dont give myself time to celebrate the here and now. We all need to do that more but life does make it hard, everything is just a bit too fast. So what Im saying to you I guess, is remember that you are worthy, try to slow down, celebrate your achievements when they happen!   I thought this photo was fitting because I am both happy/excited and nervous here. Happy Im hanging out in nature, but nervous because Im balancing on a rock whilst @nabiltravels is throwing rocks at me to create the splash  and balance is poor - see last video  but at least Im sort of in the moment! The other times Im truly living in the moment are when Im concentrated on a bake or a game. But sadly cant do that all the time!! But it does really help.  Thank you to all of you who support me and have preordered already, I really really appreciate it more than you know.

Ive been working on this magical co-operative card game for ages, along with the amazing team at @skyboundtabletop - since we by chance met at San Diego comic con back in 2019. You may know that me and @nabiltravels met through playing boardgames together, and Ive always loved how both baking and games bring people together in similar ways. So since 2019 Ive been working with @skyboundtabletop on getting the bakes just right, the right puns in there, and making sure its accessible so everyone can play and learn the rules quickly. I wanted the overall vibe of being in a magic bakery set in a forest, where all the customers are various animals wanting millefeuille, raspberry pavlova, macarons, etc! And you got to work together to bake their order otherwise they might go away! And theres that bit of fun chaos as there are different scenarios where for example, a cat sits on your cards and get in the way of your baking, or the mice switch the labels! I am so excited about this. So much excitement at the moment with my new book out, as well as this now too, my brain is fizzled   Link in my bio! Click it, then click on Kim-Joys Magic Bakery - THANK YOU!!   Thanks to the whole Skybound team, @kepneraptor for the amazing game design,  @jamesmatthewhudson for getting this out there and being amazing and @housecatillustration for the illustrations that bring this game to life!

This is my phoenix cake to celebrate bonfire night - something a little bit different to the normal! Its decorated with a creme brulee top, rough gold edge, rice paper sail flames, fondant phoenix, swipes of coloured buttercream fire, and gold leaf. Inside Ive done various options for the cake and filling so you can mix and match! But for this cake I recommend the creme brulee cake recipe (delicious stiff but silky creme pat between layers, and lots of vanilla) to go with the theme  but what I also love about this design, is you could do a similar thing but with different animals (dinosaurs!! ) and for different celebrations, and it can be simplified if you like! Imagine a sea themed one, with blue sails and a dolphin or mermaid splashing in? Probably without the brulee top. But instead you could put a jelly layer on top!

Was going to do a smooth watercolour buttercream effect for this cake, but after smoothing it over just once, it had these naturally super pretty cracks and dents, so I left it and highlighted these bits with edible gold paint to tie in with the rest of the cake! I really like this technique and will definitely do it more in the future! Im constantly learning new things about baking and I love that about it! The little pink meringue at the back also baked up with a little mouth so I couldnt resist giving it a surprise face  baking is all about going with the flow and not making it perfect, just giving it some personality! Inside is a lemon and orange sponge, with vanilla (with a hint of almond extract) buttercream and fresh blueberries  happy baking!!!   . . . . #baking #cakedecorating #cakeideas #cutecake #birthdaycake #birthdaycakeideas #birthdaycakesforgirls #unicorncakes #mermaidcake #bakinglove #bakingideas #ilovecake #cakedesign",

Just like my other books, this one is full of colour, joy and puns to keep you going. Hopefully its a book you can escape into and find yourself in a different magical world, one where trees are made from candyfloss and dinosaurs live on cheesecakes.  there are bakes for loads of different celebrations, all around the world! Its available to preorder right NOW! (link in my bio)  and thank you so so much to those of you who have already preordered, and if you havent yet, I really appreciate it if you would like to!  Baking is so amazing for our mental health, and is such a happy thing (even when things dont go to plan!), so Ive done everything I can to make this book embody that. Its not just a book of recipes, its a book of happiness, magic and embracing mistakes, and the creativity that comes from all of that combined. There are bakes for you if youre a beginner, as well as if youre advanced! You can also adapt so much and create your own magic. Loads of vegan and gluten free options too!!  I love seeing all your recipes and photos from my previous books, and hope you love this one just as much!  I dont want to go on about it for too long, but really so much love and hard work has gone into this  and theres a bunch of super special people who have made it happen (all these people are truly fabulous!!! It also helps that Ive worked with most of them on my previous two books too, and it really is a dream team and winning formula!) - everyone at @quadrillebooks, @celinebilliejean (my wonderful editor ), @ellisparrinder (photographer of dreams ), @hebe_konditori (best ever baking buddy/food stylist ), @charlottelovely (prop perfection!) @aliciahousedesign (design/making everything come together!) @housecatillustration (illustrations to bring everything to life!), @marykatemcdevitt (title lettering ), hair&makeup @danni_hair_makeup  Running out of space  thanks again and happy baking everyone  lots more to come! #baking #kimjoy #recipes #bakingbook #happybaking #cutebakes #bake",

I do this to make sure that the surface won't stick to the french toast. - Dip your bread in the egg mixture and make sure both sides are covered! - Place the bread on the griddle and do this until your griddle is full, I was able to get a whole loaf of Texas Toast bread on my 36 inch griddle. - After a couple of minutes check to see if the egg mixture will is cooked and flip to the other side when ready. A long spatula from the Blackstone Accessory kit will make the French toast flipping so much easier! - Repeat the process until you are out of bread! - Serve with fresh cut fruit and drizzle of raw honey  ENJOY!  : @dessertbae TAG SOMEONE WHO LOVES FRENCH TOAST",

As soon as it begins to simmer, remove from heat and stir in the vanilla extract. Set aside to cool for 10 minutes. - Bring about 5 cups of water to a boil on the stovetop to use later in the water bath Place either (8) 4-ounce ramekins, (6) 5-ounce ramekins (my fav), or (5) 6-ounce ramekins in a roasting pan or two smaller baking pans; set aside. - Add the egg yolks and  cup granulated sugar to a mixing bowl. Beat for 2 minutes. - Using a hand whisk and whisking constantly, slowly drizzle  cup (eyeball it) warmed heavy cream into the egg mixture; whisk until completely incorporated. Repeat with another  cup warmed cream. Once combined, slowly whisk in the remaining warmed cream until combined, whisking constantly. - Pour the custard into a large liquid measuring cup, Evenly divide the custard between the ramekins. Transfer boiling water to a separate (or cleaned) liquid measuring cup or pitcher. - Transfer the roasting pan with custard to the middle oven rack then immediately pour the hot water into the pan around the custard until it reaches about  up the sides of the ramekins.  - Bake at 325 degrees F for 25-45 minutes or until the center registers 170 degrees F on an instant read thermometer. The custard should be barely set, not liquid, but still jiggly all over. The baking time will depend on the depth of the ramekins; shallow 1-inch ramekins (5-6 ounces) will take closer to 25 minutes, deep 2-inch ramekins (4 ounces) will take closer to 45 minutes). - Remove the custards using tongs to a cooling rack and let cool to room temperature, 1-2 hours. Cover custards with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 4 hours up to 3 days before adding the sugar topping. : @dessertbae TAG SOMEONE WHO LOVES CRME BRL",

Add all your dry ingredients into a bowl (except mini chocolate chips) and mix to avoid clumping. 2 Add your wet ingredients and mix till you have a cookie dough like consistency. Then fold in your mini chocolate chips. 3 Line your oven safe pan with parchment paper and then use your cookie dough scooper to add the cookie dough balls across the parchment paper. I have a medium size cookie scooper. Remember this dough should make 18 cookies. Leave enough room to press these dough a bit before baking! 4 Dip your fingers into a little bit of water and then press the cookie dough balls into shape of medium size cookies like the chewy chips ahoy ones. 5 Add to the oven for EXACTLY 4 minutes. Once done, they might seem underbaked which is fine! Let them cool on the pan for 15 minutes or so to set. Make sure to not use a spatula or anything to take them off the parchment until they have set. If you lift them off their original spot, when they set, they will more than likely shrink more than wed want. Once set, then its time to enjoy! Substitution deets in the comments below ",

Add those to a shallow bowl. In another shallow bowl, add your egg and egg whites. Whisk those together. In your last shallow bowl, add your flour, sea salt and garlic powder. Whisk those together. 2 Now use the left hand/right hand technique, add your mozzarella stick into your flour with your left hand. Coat well and shake off any of the excess. Then add the mozzarella stick into the egg bowl and coat with your right hand. Make sure all the mozzarella stick has been covered by the egg. Lastly, add to your cheetos bowl and coat well with your left hand. 3 Now repeat this process with that same mozzarella stick the double coat is important for the cheese to stay on the inside. Repeat this process for all your mozzarella sticks. 4 Add to a plate and add to the freezer for at least 2 hours. These need to be frozen solid so when you air fry them, the outsides will get crispy and the inside will be perfectly melty when its done cooking. If you dont let them freeze, the cheese will come spilling out and youll have a flat mozzarella stick. 5 Once frozen, preheat your air fryer to 390 Degrees F. THIS IS SUPER IMPORTANT! If you dont preheat it, the mozzarella stick will actually thaw out in the air fryer while its going from cold to the 390 Degrees F. 6 Once preheated, spray the tray with non stick cooking spray and then add your mozzarella sticks in there making sure none are touching. Spray the tops with non stick cooking spray and then air fry on 5 minutes. Once done, its time to enjoy those cheese pulls fooooo dayzzzzz!",

Youll notice the outside layers of the onion are pretty flimsy and weak so I choose to not use those 1-2 layers for the rings. 2 Now set up your 3 stations for the coating of the onion rings.

Then add to your panko covering the whole onion with panko.

I spray a little bit of cooking spray on my hands to make the dough a bit easier to work with. Now knead your dough for about 6-8 minutes. 4 Add the dough to a bowl thats been sprayed with non stick butter spray. Add plastic wrap on top and let rise for 2 hours. 5 After the 2 hours, the dough should have at least doubled in size. Add to your floured surface and knead the dough one more time for another 6-8 minutes. Then roll out until its about 1/5 of an inch. Then use your biscuit cutter to cut out the donuts. Bigger one for the donut and then the smaller one to cut out the middle. Carefully transfer the donuts to a pan covered in parchment paper to let sit till all 12 donuts are formed. Youll probably need to roll out the dough 3-4 times to get all 12 donuts. 6 Preheat your air fryer to 350 Degrees F. Once preheated, spray the tray with non stick butter spray. Then carefully add your donuts to the air fryer (I could fit 4) without deflating or changing their shape. Spray tops with non stick butter spray and air fryer on 350 Degrees F for 3 minutes. 7 Once done, dip in your glaze and let sit on cooling rack till icing has set. Then its time to enjoy!

She had to work just as hard to meet expectations of the team and I in just a short amount of time, just as any permanent position holds. You did so well, some seasoned cooks that come to apply dont work as well as you did and you werent even interviewing for a job. You simply did what came natural, cared for Arlo Grey just as we do, took to our team teaching you, listened intently, & acted confidently. Mae you are exceptional, respectful, kind, funny, and talented. We are thrilled to have had you. Come back anytime - you are part of our family now.

Today, it's the turn of MICHELIN Plate awarded restaurant @kodawariramen.   You don't have to travel to Tokyo to feel like you're in the Land of the Rising Sun. The bustling vibe and narrow dimensions of this restaurant located in Paris are reminiscent of an eatery in historic Tokyo. Everything gives us the feeling of being in a Yokocho with the decoration and its unavoidable gadgets coming directly from Japan. Surprisingly enough, a soundtrack of Tokyo street ambience runs in loop inside the restaurant.   Behind this true temple dedicated to Ramen, stands a former fighter pilot and airline pilot, Jean-Baptiste Meusnier; who has an overwhelming passion for Japanese culture and especially for its gastronomy, Ramen. There, the ramen made on site and served in delicious broths of Landes poultry, attract not only Japanese culture enthusiasts, but gourmets from every horizon.

Its been one year since our world stopped because of the accident, and although most things around me in my world may seem to keep on turning, theres a hole in my heart that keeps me from moving on. Its the strangest thing, really, how so many feelings can coexist in my mind. Grief and hope had never been in the same sentence for me before.  They say it gets better. It does a tiny bit. And then it doesnt. And then it really doesnt. And then you find ways to still function, work, and press on. You find ways to get up and show up. Eventually theres times when you have a real smile again somehow.  How can it already be a year? It just barely happened in my mind. I still dont understand why it happened. I dont think things like this happen for a reason. I dont think God was trying to teach us something from this. It just was a really sad thing that happened.  I do know that God is good. He has held up the loved ones my Dad left behind in ways I didnt think would be possible. My mom, my brothers, my sister, my Dads family and friends - we all miss him terribly.  How could we all be able to continue truly living with all this grief on our backs without some kind of strength and help that exceeds reason?  Hes there. Angels are around us. They were there that day, and they continue to surround us.  Thats what I cling to on days like this. God is with us in the good, and is with us during the unimaginable. I dont know how else I could have personally gotten through this so far.  Love you, Dad. Your little blondie misses you so very much today and always.  Thank you, everyone, for allowing me to share my feelings in this space. I know its not all cake and sunshine in my world. Cake is healing at times for me, but doesnt fix everything. So many of you have been through grief (recently or what still feels like your loss was recent) and I want you to know youre not alone, and your messages have given me strength. My heart continues to go out to you . Xo",

I was a band geek in middle school, high school, and that extended my love of saxophone performance clear through college at Brigham Young University and beyond.  In high school, after every concert, my friends and I would all pile into our little cars and head over to the nearest A&W for a frosty mug.  It was an ice cold mug with a large handle that theyd fill clear to the top with frothing, foaming, tap root beer.  Even better, it was refillable.  We went so often that I still crave root beer after each of my performances in the Utah Wind Symphony (missing them these days!).  My little family and I keep the tradition alive by stopping at a soda shop together after my concerts to share something sweet to drink. I dont mind one bit.  Hope yall are having a good weekend  If youre looking for a crazy delicious root beer cake & cupcake recipe, this goodie is in Cake Confidence (second edition preorder is already available ).

This time I did chocolate, but Ive made a few recipe-testing cakes this year when Biscoff paired beautifully with strawberry, pumpkin, banana, white chocolate, dark chocolate, raspberry, caramel, cream cheese, gingerbread, etc. I asked Ryan what hed pair Biscoff with and he said airplanes.  Hes not wrong, right?  What do you pair your Biscoff with?   Chocolate cupcakes, Biscoff crumble, Biscoff buttercream, Biscoff drizzle, and a Biscoff cookie on top!",

You can pre-make your American buttercream, and this is how:  (Save this for when you need to pre-make a lot of buttercream or would like to make it in advance anytime).  : Make your buttercream as usual.  : Wrap it twice in plastic wrap  like I have in this video.  : Place it just like this in the fridge for up to a week. If youre doing longer, wrap it again in aluminum foil and keep it in the freezer.  : The buttercream changes consistency in the cold, so to bring it back to frosting-the-cake consistency, leave it out at room temp for an hour or two (length depends on your climate and kitchen temperature).  : Unwrap, then place it in your stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment. Whip on high speed until its light and fluffy again!  Thats it! Have you tried this storage method before? Another method? Id love to hear it.  #bakingwithblondie",

How:  - Freeze your lemon cupcakes (covered) and then theyll easily scoop out with a melon baller.  - Add your lemon curd filling to a drip bottle to easily add the filling to each cupcake (no mess!)  - Press the cake scoop back on top to seal it off.  - Pipe on a gorgeous Berry Buttercream swirl and top with fresh berries .  This is my cake & buttercream flavor for tonights cake class, and is definitely one of my favorite summer flavors! Recipe is in my first & best selling cookbook, Cake Confidence .

Chocolate mold pieces, sprinkles of all sizes, different sizes of piping tips and shades of buttercream, a variety of textures, a small drip of ganache, and even a teeny tiny mermaid tail snuck on top can make your little ones eyes light up  They really make it extra special for those were celebrating!  Lets talk molds and chocolate: Have you used chocolate molds to embellish a cake before?  Not all molds and melting chocolate are created equal, so my biggest tip would be to find something that has a lot of give/squish, and make sure to tap your chocolate flat to fill in all the little spaces in the mold before it hardens.  I love using @wiltoncakes & @sweettoothfairy bright white melts for fun details like the ones I used on this mermaid cake.  Melt it in the microwave for 30 seconds and stir. Add 10 seconds, stir, and repeat until its melted. It wont seize if youre going slow and stirring between.   I loved how this sweet little cake turned out! Its filled with chocolate cake and raspberry buttercream , for my nieces birthday in June.  #bakingwithblondie",

There are three types of bees that make up a colony: worker, drone, and queen (of which there is only one per hive). Within this hyper-organized hive are many types of worker bees, all of which are female and with very specific tasks at hand. Youve got cleaning bees to clean and polish the cells. Nurse bees to produce royal jellythe only food source for the queen. Building bees that excrete wax from glands in their abdomen and then use it to construct the combs.  Guard bees that are positioned at the hive entrance, and only allow bees with a similar scent (pheremone); they also protect from invaders such as bumblebee and wasps. Fanning bees to cool and ventilate the hive. Foraging bees that collect nectar, pollen, water and propolis. And last but perhaps most important, scout bees to source new places to forage nectar and pollen and for future colonies. Each are vital to the success of the hive. If were lucky and all that falls into place, the queen will lay her eggs and the cycle continues with the next generation.  Of course, no show and tell is complete without trying something new, and our team was lucky enough to taste some of the first honey that will be harvested from our hives later this summer.",

Yes, it was a bit of a fail, but this weekend when I gathered all my neighbors to do an outdoor viewing of the show launch I made her the banana pudding again and she ate THREE of them. We danced into the evening and all was happy on our block again!  Truth be told, I still like it with unsweetened whipped cream, but I will reserve that version for an older crowd!

Thank you, @joannagaines and @chipgaines for inviting me into your incredible Magnolia Network Family and allowing me to dance (I mean bake) my way around this inspiring city that is Minneapolis!  The new episodes: Biscuit Bake - Meet @chefjustinsutherland from @handsome_hog , who shows me his famous (and ginormous) biscuits. Then it SNOWS just in time for a neighbor's BBQ, because that's how we roll in MPLS! I make accidental cobbler and I learn a valuable lesson about children and sweets!  Making Meringue - My house has a ballroom on the top floor we converted into an apartment, where my dear friend & fellow food blogger, @stephanie.a.meyer, creates extraordinary food. It's like a foodie commune. She's having a party and I'm making dessert (as I do). To get inspiration I head to a church basement to meet local baker, Rachel @pieandmightymsp , who shows me her grandmother's Angel Pie and teaches me a whole new BAKING VOCABULARY.  She is pure baking joy and absolutely hilarious. Oh, and I make my signature Pavlova from Zo Bakes Cakes for our Australian neighbors and the most famous pastry chef in town, @themichellegayer ! No pressure there!  Decorating Cakes - It's my best friend's wedding anniversary and I want to bake her a cake inspired by her 1990s photo album. I head to @thecopperhen to get some ideas on how to do a more \"of the moment\" take on @chickenladymns cake. @mindajoy10, the pastry chef, shows me some techniques I'd never seen before (LOVE THAT) and I'll teach you a bunch of fun tricks too.

Add a bottle of wine, some fine cheese, BBQ and you have my idea of a perfect summer meal. #oregonorchardambassador @hazelnutgrowers Hazelnuts are one of my favorite companions with chocolate. Their distinct, almost buttery flavor naturally complements other ingredients by joining together in perfect harmony. Imagine the best, richest, most decadent chocolate hazelnut brownie in the world with a fancier name. This torte (cake) gets even better (and slightly gooey) when it is served at room temperature, so feel free to pack it in your picnic basket, even on these warm evenings. The candied hazelnut garnish is best reserved for cooler weather, but you can chop up roasted hazelnuts and toss them on top for a more casual garnish and a wonderful crunch. This cake is naturally gluten-free and thanks to the added hazelnuts is an excellent source of protein, omegas 6 and 9, vitamin-B complex, and FLAVOR! So, you can feel good about eating dessert first!  Be sure to find a grocery location near you to stock up on delicious Oregon Orchard hazelnuts!

This summer I crave everything cold, creamy, sweet, delicious, and indulgent. Wildgood delivers on all of it and is 100% plant-based, only 2g fat and they are from my hometown of Montpelier, VT! #Sponsored Wildgood has so many great qualities, but for me it must start with the taste, and I just LOVE it. Ive tried each flavor and theyre all bold and super delicious. The surprise is how Wildgood gets such creamy texture and balance flavor, without any dairy. The secret is extra virgin olive oil! Mind blown. I think everyone knows the virtues and superpowers of the Mediterranean diet, based on olive oil, but not as ice cream. It is a masterful stroke of brilliance by Sotiris Tsichlopoulos, who brought the fruits of his familys Greek olive groves to the mountains of Vermont to create the worlds best-tasting ice cream with one goal in mind: to replace dairy with a healthy, sustainable, and delicious alternative. The result is a brand new, first-of-its-kind, plant-based frozen dessert made with the goodness of extra virgin olive oil.    Wildgood sent me every flavor and I ate them in a cone, in a bowl, with and without hot fudge and finally layered all the flavors into a gorgeous dessert with ganache and cake to serve at a party. You can see all my serving suggestions in my stories.    *GIVEAWAY ~ Wed love to spark a little wonder and awe by sending you some @Wildgood frozen dessert. Ive partnered with the Wildgood team to send EIGHT Cartons (a selection of all  the flavors) of Wildgood ice cream, two ceramic ice cream bowls and a Wildgood Tote Bag to One lucky winner. Here is how to enter:    1. Like this post, because its ice cream folks!  2. Follow @Wildgood and me, youll find lots more tasty content. 3.

Ive had several people ask how I go about decorating with fresh flowers, so I made a Reel to show the process.

Da das kommende Halbfinale in Grobritannien stattfindet, begeben wir uns heute nach Irland. Tatschlich wurde zur Tea Time im 18. Jahrhundert meistens Kaffee serviert und mit rund 9000 Cafs im 19. Jahrhundert allein in London gehrten die Englnder zu den leidenschaftlichsten Kaffeetrinkern der Welt  Um 1850 herum wurde Tee gnstiger und Kaffee trat in den Hintergrund, weshalb England und Irland zu den Teetrinkern wurden, als welche sie heute bekannt sind. Kaffee wird zwar noch immer serviert und getrunken, jedoch, weil sie ihn sehr lange ziehen lassen, deutlich bitterer und  sogar schrfer als bei uns und daher etwas ungewohnt. Ein Getrnk was es zu uns geschafft hat ist jedoch der Irish Coffee und diesen habe ich zubereitet, wenn auch auf meine eigene Art. Normalerweise besteht der Irish Coffee aus einer Tasse starkem Kaffee mit braunem Zucker, Whiskey und Milch- bzw. Sahneschaum obendrauf, wo ich statt Whiskey selbstgemachten Karamell-Vanillesirup dazugegeben habe. Alternativ kann man auch fertigen Kaffeesirup aus dem Handel verwenden  Das vollstndige Rezept, auch zum Vanillesirup, findet Ihr die nchsten Tage bei @GRAEF_Elektrokleingeraete. Auch so ist es ein leckeres Getrnk fr den nchsten Fuball-Abend, was dazu auch noch super aussieht. Neben dem GRAEF Multi-Zerkleinerer fr den Kuchen, habe ich fr den Espresso noch die GRAEF CM850 Kaffeemhle und die GRAEF Contessa Siebtrgermaschine benutzt, zu der es auch einen Blogbeitrag bei mir gibt, und zuletzt den GRAEF Milchaufschumer. Einige von vielen hochwertigen und top Produkten von GRAEF, die ich schon seit Monaten nutze. #GRAEFSiebtrgerEM #Graef #irishcoffee ",

Dazu kommt die Korean Fried Chicken Soe der Marke Sempio, was dem Hhnchen den Geschmack wie im koreanischen Restaurant gibt. Es ist eine Kombination aus Soya-Soe, Knoblauch, Ingwer und weiteren Zutaten. Dadurch bekommt es erst seinen charakteristischen Geschmack. Wer will kann es aber auch als Dip nutzen  Dazu kommen die Skartoffel-Glasnudeln von Ottogi. Vermicelli, die nach koreanischer Tradition 100% aus Skartoffelstrke hergestellt werden und mit der s-scharfen Gochujang Soe sowie Sesam eine tolle Beilage wird  Was in einem koreanischen Men nicht fehlen darf ist Kimchi, hier von der Marka Jongga. Kimchi ist normalerweise vermentiertes Gemse, hier fermentierter Chinakohl, was mit Gewrzen nochmal verfeinert wird. Kimchi schmeckt nicht nur, sondern hat auch viele anerkannte gesundheitliche Vorteile, weshalb es sowohl in Korea, als auch hier sehr beliebt ist  Dazu serviert habe ich noch Skartoffeln aus dem Ofen, gebratene Karotten, Paprika, Pak Choi, Brokoli, sowie je ein Ei mit einer speziellen Zubereitung in einer Kelle.

Fr die Extraschrfe bei der Zubereitung nutze ich den HORL 2 von @horl1993  Es ist eines der besten Kchengadgets, die man sich zulegen kann und mit Sicherheit etwas, was in keiner Kche fehlen darf. Whrend ein normaler Wetzstein viel bung und Geduld bentigt, kompliziert ist und dem Messer bei selbst kleinen Fehlern schaden kann, braucht man mit dem HORL 2 keine Vorkenntnisse und kann selbst mit den edelsten Messern nichts falsch machen. Je nachdem, was man schrfen mchte whlt man die Seite mit 15 oder 20 Winkel, bringt das Messer magnetisch an, sodass es automatisch perfekt ausgerichtet ist und nutzt dann den den Rollschleifer. Dieser kommt mit einer Diamant-Schleifseite und einer Keramik-Abziehseite zum gltten nach dem Schleifen. Hier braucht man nur ansetzen und ganz locker losrollen. Damit hat man ein perfektes Ergebnis innerhalb weniger Minuten mit konstantem Schleifwinkel, was aufgrund der beiden unterschiedlichen Winkel der Magnethalterung Kchenmesser jeder Qualitt und Art abdeckt  Viele Leute schleifen Ihre Damastmesser erst wenn sie komplett abgestumpft sind oder nutzen alle paar Wochen oder Monate einen teuren Schleifservice, wo man sich den rger, die Zeit und das Geld mit dem HORL 2 komplett sparen kann. Man kauft es sich nur einmal und hat damit ein Kchenwerkzeug fr ein ganzes Kchenleben und darber hinaus, da der Diamantschleifstein aufgrund des Werkstoffes quasi ewig hlt. Nicht nur fr Hobby- oder Profikche, sondern fr jeden Haushalt halte ich den HORL 2 fr ein perfektes Kchengadget, was auch als Geschenk sicher super gut ankommen wrde. Auch mir wurde das damals von einem Kollegen empfohlen ",

I came here full with hopes and dreams and accomplished more than I could imagine! This is where I graduated college, got my first job, met my true love Booby, discovered I was an artist, bought our first home, started FlavCity, published our first cookbook, gave birth to Rose Honey! My heart is full of gratitude for this gorgeous city that has has inspired me to paint its magnificent city scapes and given me so much!  Featuring here one of my favorite paintings and that is how I will always think of Chicago - summer heat, long walks by the lake and river cruises  Now heading south to tropical paradise, the ocean, the beach and the sun! A place where I hope to connect more with nature and be more of a human being and a little less of a human doing!",

Gas, charcoal or even an indoor grill works  Ingredients 3/4 pound medium shrimp, deveined with tails removed 1/2 teaspoon oregano  2 tablespoons olive oil  Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper  3 tablespoons unsalted butter  3 tablespoons all-purpose flour, plus more for rolling dough  2 cloves garlic, grated  1 1/2 cups milk  1/2 cup grated Parmesan 1 pound frozen pizza dough, thawed  All-purpose flour, for dusting 1 cup deli mozzarella (part-skim, low-moisture), grated  Red pepper flakes, for sprinkling  3 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley  Directions  Preheat a grill pan over medium-high heat. Sprinkle the shrimp in a bowl with the oregano, 1 tablespoon olive oil, 1/2 teaspoon salt and a pinch of pepper. Heat a skillet over medium-high heat, then add the butter and let melt. Add the flour and cook, 1 minute. Add the garlic and continue to cook, whisking, 1 minute more. Whisk in the milk and cook until very thick, 2 to 3 minutes. Stir in 1/4 cup Parmesan and remove from the heat. Season with a pinch of salt and pepper. Preheat the broiler to high. Roll out the pizza dough on a lightly-floured work surface into two 10-inch ovals. Brush the grill pan with the remaining tablespoon olive oil. Grill the dough on both sides until there are grill marks, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Remove the crusts to a sheet tray. Add the shrimp to the grill pan and grill on both sides until fully cooked, pink and opaque, about 4 minutes total. Spread the white sauce on the dough in an even layer. Scatter the shrimp over the sauce. Sprinkle with the mozzarella and the remaining 1/4 cup Parmesan. Place under the broiler until the cheese is melted and bubbly, keeping a close eye so it doesn't burn, 2 to 7 minutes. Sprinkle the red pepper flakes and parsley on top before serving.  #deliciousmissbrown #pizza #recipe",

Sus propios productos que pronto podras pedirlos desde varios paises para aplicarlos tu misma en casa porque es muy fcil. Cuanto cuesta el tratamiento? Todo depende de tu cabello y el largo Para que tengas una idea La mia cuesta $200 En el salon Pero si quieres hacertelo en casa puedes comprar los productos y el tutorial Pregunten en @maybeautymiami #hidratacion #cabellolargo #hairstyle #hair",

We talk about good eating habits around here on a daily basis!  For instance:  *Do not sit down with a bag of potato chips. Put some on your plate!  *Do not snack after every meal. Eat when its meal time so you dont end up snacking in between.  *Have a snack in the afternoon if you are hungry before dinnertime! A cookie, a piece of fruit, some yogurt, popcorn, a few nuts, cheese and cracker.  *Try to eat before 7 pm unless your main meal is in the afternoon. If so, eat a light dinner! Here in America we are accustomed to eating our heavier meal at dinner thats why we try to not eat after 7 pm.  *When the kitchen is closed everyone be done. Dont eat after dinner unless its a small serving of dessert and not every night!  *when eating out share your food!  *Everyone needs to get plenty of exercise. Walking  is super healthy!  *Make sure to eat a balanced diet with plenty of greens! If you look down and there is nothing green on your plate for your main meal you need to make sure to add that.  *Make meat choices smaller and vegetables more important!  *When ordering fast food for the kids have them share French fries or get a kid meal!  *Push your plate back when you are satisfied, not stuffed or full! Practice portion control which is eating less!  These are just a few basic healthy ideas that we teach around here on a daily basis!  Liam and the rest of us all wish everyone a happy 4th of July!!  Stay safe and enjoy your traditions!  Eat more watermelon!  ***Swipe to see the comment that I got  my message is actually opposite !!!! Im trying to teach you how to have a healthy relationship with food and learn good eating habits and teach your children ***  Keep Cooking Your Family Is Worth It   Me !!!!! #thefoodnanny #kamut #kids #portioncontrol #family #healthylifestyle #familydinner #dinnertime",

Mom is obsessed with Julia Child who favored the French style pin which is a hardwood dowel with no handles. Professionals prefer this style as it gives them a better feel for the dough.  We are obsessed with our French Pin which we believe is the perfect size decorated with Copper ends.  The Copper adds just a touch of elegance to the pin which gives it a kitchen art touch that we are so in love with Julia used to keep her Rolling Pins in a copper stock pot which is so dreamy who could imagine it! We keep ours in an old antique olive oil pot from Italy!! Whatever you have around the house that calls you place your gorgeous pin or pins in it and relish in this beautiful-hand made tool!!  This Pin is hand made right here in our own back yard by Dough Hook Man @nuquestutah USA Made !!  *We still have pre orders going for this beauty!  Get someone a gift or buy one for yourself!!!!  Julia Child was obsessed with France , the food first, and all things Kitchen! She loved her country more,  but appreciated the detail of their cooking and kitchen art. We are twins! We feel exactly the same way! Get on board with us and relish in fabulous kitchen art from thefoodnanny. Each piece of ours will fill your days with happiness!!!  Baking never looked better!  PS.

My daily reminder, no matter how I feel, is to show up. Because honestly the days I dont like it are the days I need it most. If I only showed up when I felt amazing and ambitious my consistency would be garbage, and consistency is the key to advancing forward towards change   Fun fact: I HATE leg day, its my least favorite day  but it was on my workout calendar so I accepted the challenge and got it done. 28 minutes later feelin proud and strong!

My children had the opportunity to meet their great grandmother for the second time. What a blessing. My grandmother handed some family recipes down, and gave me all her recipe secrets! Being here is more than just the photo ops, its about teaching my children where their ancestry lies and allowing them to know and understand that they descended from kings & queens. Truly knowing who they are and what type of blood runs through their veins. Id encourage all of my peers to continue to visit the country that our parents came from, keep our culture alive by teaching your children all about our food, music, and customs. Contribute to the local economy by patronizing the businesses owned by the countrys citizens, and most importantly, dont let our culture die with our generation. ",

The reason we do this is so that it comes up to temperature together in the oil gets infused with the garlic. Turn the heat on medium-high and as soon as the oil gets hot add in the cherry tomatoes. You want them to sizzle. Add a pinch of salt and stir everything for 2-3 minutes. The moment the cherry tomatoes are nice and soft and the garlic isnt burnt the sauce is ready and turn the heat off. Add your cooked pasta with a bit of the starchy pasta water and gently stir it together. Serve with fresh basil, parm and a touch of olive oil is optional. Enjoy ",

Made this one earlier this year, and Im still so in love with these flavors (which were inspired by @clodagh_mckenna). I finally typed out the full recipe this time!  RECIPE GALETTE DOUGH (recipe from Tartine) 1/2 tsp salt 1/3 cup very cold water 1 1/2 cups plus 1 tbsp flour 1 stick butter + 2.5 tbsp butter, very cold  GALETTE FILLING 1 yellow onion, sliced and eight sauted or caramelized 1 cup cooked squash (toss in oil and bake at 425 for ~30 min) 1/4 cup feta A few leaves of fresh sage Zaatar (a Middle Eastern spice blend, my fave to buy is @zandzdc) Hot honey (like spicy  honey. Love @mikeshothoney!) Everything but the bagel seasoning To prepare dough, mix the salt into the cold water. Cut butter into 1-inch pieces. Add the flour & butter pieces to a food processor, and pulse until a ball forms. Transfer to a flour lined surface and form into a 1-inch thick disk using your hands. Wrap in plastic and chill in fridge for at least 2 hours. Let cool slightly before working with dough. When youre ready to use the dough, preheat oven to 425 F, and use a rolling pin to shape into a rough circle, about 1/8 in thick. Transfer the dough carefully to a parchment paper-lined baking sheet. Add the sauteed onions to the center of the dough, leaving a 3-inch border like a pizza crust (youll fold this over). Layer with the butternut squash, feta, sage, and a sprinkle of za'atar. Fold the crust over, and brush with an egg wash. Sprinkle with bagel seasoning & za'atar. Bake for 30 minutes until edges are golden brown, and then drizzle with hot honey!",

RECIPE :  3 tablespoons Tonys Seafood Marinade Tonys More Spice Creole Seasoning, to taste 20 colossal shrimp - peeled but tails left on Olive oil 5 large Russet Potatoes 1 (14oz) kielbasa sausage link, cut into cubes 1/2 small red pepper, diced 1 stick of butter 1/4 cup sour cream 1 cup shredded white cheddar cheese 1 cup milk 1 tablespoon Tonys ranch dressing 1/3 cup Tonys Alfredo sauce Sliced Green onions, to taste In a large bowl, combine Tonys Seafood marinade and 1 teaspoon Tonys More Spice Seasoning to defrosted shrimp and allow to marinate in the fridge at least 30 minutes. Preheat oven to 400 degrees. Wash potatoes then dry them. Poke holes around them and rub with olive oil. Bake for about 1 hour until cooked through. Upon removal, leave oven on, but lower to 350. They will go back in later. Heat a medium-sized, non-stick skillet over medium heat. Add your cubed kielbasa sausage and red peppers and cook until lightly browned. Set aside. In the same pan, add your marinated shrimp and cook about 2 minutes each side until shrimp are cooked/pink. Set aside. Once the potatoes are cooked, slice them in half and scoop out the centers into a bowl leaving a little behind against the skins to keep them sturdy. Once all the potatoes are scooped into the bowl, add the Tonys More Heat Seasoning (I added about 2 teaspoons), butter, sour cream, shredded cheese, milk, and Tonys ranch dressing. Combine/mash well until desired creaminess. I like mine a little firm as it makes for easier scooping. Lay your potato shells out into a pan. Scoop the mashed potato mixture evenly into each potato skin. Spoon the cubed sausage/pepper mixture on top then drizzle the Tonys Alfredo sauce over each of them. Top each potato with 2 shrimp then sprinkle the top with a little extra More Heat! Bake at 350 for about 15 minutes or until warmed through. Top with sour cream and chives and enjoy! ",

I then uncover it and broil it for about 5-10 minutes at 525 or until browned to my desired color!   2. Clean your chicken first - this doesnt mean you have to get rid of all the fat unless you want to. The fat actually cooks down and makes for an extra flavorful gravy .  3. The chimichurri marinade I used is from @havenskitchen and the jerk marinade was from @gracefoods .  4. The heavy lid makes a difference!

People be letting their 2 year old kids and pets get into their stash.. read story below  On Memorial Day weekend, a 6-year-old girl ate a THC gummy after mistaking it for candy. Now that she's fully recovered, her mom-Morgan McCoy from Pensacola, Florida-is calling for safer packaging of marijuana edibles. McCoy stepped out to visit her sister, and one of the other guests jumped into the pool after their 2-year-old child. The parent was fully clothed and had a package of Faded Fruits Hawaiian Punch gummies in their pocket; there was one gummy left in the package. The parent changed clothes and put the gummy package in a dresser. When McCoy's daughter went to change, she came across the bag \"and, like any 6-year-old would... she ate the candy,\" says McCoy. McCoy later learned that the gummy had 50 mg of THC, the psychoactive compound in marijuana. For comparison, 10 mg of THC is the industry norm, said Morgan Fox, media relations director at the National Cannabis Industry Association, to Today. McCoy returned and found the kids sleeping, and she wasn't concerned until the parent suggested her daughter \"may have taken a THC gummy,\" she says, adding that her daughter couldn't open her eyes. \"She was completely non-responsive and when I laid her down she kind of braced herself like she felt like she was falling.\" Soon she started seizing, and McCoy called an ambulance for her daughter. Eventually, though, her daughter recovered and went home. McCoy says was \"one of the scariest moments\" of her life. \"Had there been more than ONE [gummy] in that package, it is more than likely that I would not have my daughter today,\" she said. Now she's calling for regulation surrounding marijuana packaging. She notes how the government puts \"child locks\" on many different things, ranging from Tide Pods to vitamins, but THC products aren't regulated. \"We as parents are standing Idly by while these companies are targeting our kids with what can be deadly doses of THC,\" she said on Facebook. \"THC is a MEDICATION and needs to be packaged as such. Period.\"",

You dont NEED empathy, nor sympathy, but compassion; only you are in charge of unconditionally providing that compassion for yourself to an extent which no other could possibly offer, nor should they be relied upon for understanding. No one is wrong in their judgement of another, just as the one being viewed in judgement isnt wrong for existing as they are, without need for involvement or consideration for outside opinion. You are whole and complete, as you are, when you are, without exception.  -Have a beautiful weekend... I love you!

I hope your weekend coming to a close brings you more excitement than anticipation for the unforeseen events yet to unfold in the week ahead. In recent times Ive been focusing on, more than ever before, the willingness to accept my emotions as they come without judgement, therefore letting the less favorable emotions to pass more quickly, but also on how to welcome in a more predictable emotional experience for myself, simply by getting EXCITED about things not yet tangible. Creating future outcomes is often easier than we allow ourselves to expect because weve been taught to fight everything, struggle harder than necessary, and compete with others because we we believe there is a limited supply of everything we desire. All of this is a fallacy to the soul who understands how plentiful the Universe is and how to attract magnetically the experiences that will yield the most joyous creations. I recommend that you start GETTING EXCITED NOW, because the miraculous events that you cannot yet imagine coming into play for you are UNDOUBTEDLY approaching and will only quicken with a conscious, decisive choice to feel excitement for their unfolding and trust that however they occur is precisely for your greatest good.  -  @mattreiterphoto",

Cultivating a better relationship with YOU can begin simply with the way you speak to yourself: I love finding new words and phrases to better describe the reality of what Im experiencing, rather than choosing to state things that belittle my opportunities to expand.  Have you ever said to yourself man up, stop being a baby, or I need to grow up? Ever stated I deserve better, why arent things improving?, or this always happens to me? These phrases are related, in that the initial perspective of the one diminishing their innocence or vulnerability is likely projecting the phrases spoken to them by a guardian or authority figure, which then brings about the same subjectively negative experiences of stagnancy and instability.  Ive made it my mission lately to find new phrases for the old paradigmatic approach to motivation. For example, man up can feel gentler and trigger more inspired action in phrases such as I have the confidence and strength to achieve what I desire. Ive replaced I hate doing/going/being etc... with I will be present and aware of the things that bring me joy while Im doing the things that will soon no longer be in my reality. I dont like these things about this person can easily be tamed by focusing on and choosing to state their likable tendencies! Everything spoken, including the statements you direct to or about yourself, has a definable polarity, and therefore negative statements can always be swapped for a softer phrase. What you choose and how it feels in your body maps out your future experiences with that which you speak negatively of, so try choosing more pleasant words and optimistic stances and youll be AMAZED at how wonderfully your perceived blockages are cleared from your path!  -  @mattreiterphoto",

According to TMZ, the cannabis vape company Dr. Dabber has offered Richardson $250k to test dab rigs and vape pens as a resident 'doctor' for the brand. Richardson has not publicly commented on the offer. After finishing first in the 100-meter race in June at the U.S. track and field trials, Richardson tested positive for THC, the psychoactive component of cannabis. She was stripped of her win and suspended, losing her chance to compete in that event at the Olympics. While she still could have competed as part of the 4x100-meter relay team, Team USA didn't select her. Richardson's situation has become a rallying cry, prompting many fans and fellow athletes to call on the IOC and other sporting bodies to revisit their draconian cannabis policies, which many see as out of step with the times. According to data compiled by Business Insider, recreational cannabis is legalized in 18 states and Washington, D.C., and medical marijuana is legal in 37. More states are expected to follow suit in the months and years ahead. #news #olympics #legalize #weed #socialjustice",

The lone exception will be for positions regulated by the Dept of Transportation, such as truck drivers. Amazon says, however, it will 'continue to do impairment checks on the job and will test for all drugs and alcohol after any incident.' In relaxing its anti-cannabis drug policies, Amazon said its public policy division is also re-evaluating the tech giant's position on cannabis with regard to its advocacy efforts. 'And because we know that this issue is bigger than Amazon, our public policy team will be actively supporting The Marijuana Opportunity Reinvestment and Expungement Act of 2021 (MORE Act)federal legislation that would legalize marijuana at the federal level, expunge criminal records, and invest in impacted communities,' Amazon said in its post. 'We hope that other employers will join us, and that policymakers will act swiftly to pass this law.' #cannabis #weed #amazon #drugtests",

The longtime @blink182 drummer says the experience is also what convinced him to get sober after years of smoking an 'excessive' amount of weed and using prescription drugs. 'If I wasnt in a crash, I would have probably never quit,' Barker said. Despite surviving the plane crash, Barker was badly burned in the incident and required 26 surgeries and 11 weeks of hospitalization in its aftermath. He told Men's Health that the experience continues to weigh on his mental health. 'I couldnt walk down the street. If I saw a plane [in the sky], I was determined it was going to crash, and I just didnt want to see it,' Barker said. Barker told Mens Health he might get on a plane again someday and looks forward to sharing the experience with his children.

When French students Hugo Maupetit and Vivian Fischer learned that fact, they created a design proposal outlining a way to repurpose chewed gum into colorful recycled skateboard wheels.  The initiative would work by installing gum boards in areas with high foot traffic, like in city centers or local skateparks. Once boards are filled up, the gum would be transferred to a factory, where it could be cleaned, molded, and dyed before a machine finally shapes it into the base of a wheel.  Maupetit and Fischer designed their concept at Lcole de design Nantes Atlantique. In an interview with Yanko Design, they said they want to ensure that materials in use stay in use and become more sustainable in the long run. Their proposal even cited Mentos and Vans as hypothetical brands that could take the initiative to greater heights. #plasticpollution #pollution #gum #chewinggum #skateboards #earthday",

They can often be used in spells as a substitution from actual dried herbs. Beware of low quality oil that are not 100% made from natural material. Always check the ingredients as impure oils wont have the same magickal properties as pure oils.  Its important undiluted essential oils are not used directly on the skin as they can seriously irritate it. They must be diluted by a carrier oil like grape seed or sunflower oil first. As I rule, I use 5-6 drops of essential oil for 1 fl oz/230mls of carrier oil, which gives you a decent sized batch. Do you use essential oils? My favourite is still lavender!

They are mostly associated with protection of people, property and animals, fertility spells and healing magick.  When you wash and dry the eggs so they can be used in spells, be sure to remove the inner membrane before drying. I only try to use free range egg shells. Eggs used from battery chickens, who live miserable lives, will pass on this kind of energy into the shells of the eggs they produce. So a happy and well cared for chicken will produce eggs with a better energy to them. A vegan alternative depends on what you want to use the eggshells for in your spell, but you could also use nuts for the symbolism of life in a pre-birth form. They have the same structure of a shell and core, and can be used in the same way as eggs for healing, protection and fertility. Crushed up sea shells are also another good alternative!

The Moon is a reminder not to take everything at face value. Sometimes we only know half a story and dont have all the information you need to move forward. Listen to your intuition so you can see beyond whats in front of you. Feel into situations rather thinking what they mean. Let go of negative self talk and allow your intuition to guide you and give you a greater level of understanding. Feel into situations rather than overthinking what they might mean. Pay attention to your dreams, they can also give you guidance about which direction to go.  3. The World reversed can suggests you are seeking some kind of closure on a personal issue but youre struggling. You know in your heart that in order to learn to accept and embrace where you are now, you must first let go of parts of your past that still have a negative impact upon you. The World is also a reminder not to try and take short cuts in all areas of your life right now. You may be tempted to take the quickest or easiest route, but it wont lead to deep change or the outcome you intend. Sometimes you have to experience life in all its ups and downs so that you can learn and grow.

I thought it might be fun to share a few really simple, easy to make recipes you might want to try out to celebrate the Sabbats! I purposely chose easy to make food so no matter what your level of cooking skills are, you can still create food that is associated with Lughnasadh and Imbolc. As Lughnasadh is the first harvest, baking bread is an ancient activity to do at this time. The very actions of making the bread can be a beautiful ritual too. As Imbolc is the beginning of spring, foods appropriate to eat on this day include all dairy products as this Sabbat is connected lambing and calving season and milk production.  For a vegan baked custard recipe, you can substitute the cows milk for a non-dairy alternative like almond or soy milk. You can also substitute each egg for 1/4 cup of plain non-dairy yogurt. Add around 1/8th teaspoon of baking soda for each egg substituted as yogurt has no leavening properties.

Lidia focuses on seven main types of Witchcraft, including green, kitchen, Wiccan, elemental, eclectic, sea and cosmic Witchcraft. Each section explores what each type is and includes rituals, guided meditations, spells and recipes to help you connect with each path in your own practice.  This book isnt about labelling your craft as one thing or another. Rather, its about helping you connect with different facets in your practice in order to help you understand your witchcraft journey in a deeper way. Highly recommended for those just starting out in the Craft as well as those questioning their path.

One of the main goals in breeding for a true line is refinement to the point of homozygosity which can be defined as predictable traits being passed on to the next generation. Though we still see some differences in structure among the population of f7's we have honed the pink and purple component which is how we originally created the name by using the term 'pinkle' as the ID markers for selection. Overall Pinkleberry Kush isn't a beginner strain and likes to be fickle with early growth and can't be depped or grown out of natural cycle without issues, but when grown properly may just be one of the most beautiful outdoor flowers in existence\" @greensourcegardens . . . #GROWYOUROWN  #cannabis #cannabiscommunity #cannabisculture #edrosenthal",

                "caption": "Excerpt from the upcoming Cannabis Grower's Handbook  . Trimming, sometimes called manicuring, is the preparation of the bud after it has been cut from the plant. How and when buds are trimmed depends on the growers goals and strategy. The purpose of trimming is to separate the highest-quality part of the plant, the ripe female flower clusters (buds), from the stems and leaves. Manicuring is one of the final steps in the post-harvest process and is a skilled task that requires training and experience. Trimming should not be confused with pruning, which is the removal of unwanted vegetation from living plants. . Parts to Be Trimmed The bud is the plants jewel. It is a cluster of flowers that grow at the nodes along and at the tip of each branch. The flowers squeeze tightly between and on top of one another, forming thick layers until the entire group is a dense floral mass, also called an inflorescence or raceme. More than one bud grows on each branch. If buds grow large enough, they grow into each other, forming one continuous group called a cola. Colas are always found on the outer extremity of the branch. The branch may grow at nearly a 90-degree angle to the plants stem, although branches of some cultivars grow diagonally or curve up. . Trimming starts with the removal of the buds from the branch (bucking). From that point, the order of the trimming process varies greatly, but to create a fully manicured bud:  The fan leaves are removed.  The sugar leaves and petioles surrounding the buds are removed.  Any damaged or contaminated material is removed. Whats left is the manicured bud. Fan leaves contain small amounts of cannabinoids, and sugar leaves contain a larger amount. Both are usually saved for extracts, concentrates, and infused-products manufacturing. . Photo @gonzo_photo_ . . . #GROWYOUROWN  #cannabis #cannabiscommunity #cannabisculture #edrosenthal",

Here is what they have to say about this plant:  Watered with only pure water throughout the season, we think, Gorilla Butter F2 bred by@FreshCoastSeedCo, came out nicely. One plant grew in a 30 gallon, seventh cycle, no till pot and is stickier than one of those sticky mouse traps. Shes a cross between Gorilla Butter x Gorilla Butter and to break it down a little further, Gorilla Butter is a cross between Gorilla Glue#4and Peanut Butter Breath. We had a chance to sample her over the weekend and after grinding her up she reeks of sweet burnt rubber. Her effects are a perfect balanced between Indica and Sativa.   .

A first Supreme Court resolution determined in 2015 that the absolute prohibition of cannabis for personal use was unconstitutional because it violates the right to the free development of personality. To reach jurisprudence in Mexico, five consecutive cases, with the same or more votes each time, must be won before the Supreme Court. This was achieved in October 2018, which detonated a legislative mandate that within 90 days, the Senate should modify the articles in the General Health Law that were deemed unconstitutional. The first deadline came and went without the Senate modifying the articles; so the Senate requested an extension, which was granted. The second deadline to legislate expired on April 30, 2020but another extension was provided because of the COVID-19 pandemic. At first, it looked like the third time was the charm. The Senate overwhelmingly approved the Federal Law to Regulate and Control Cannabis in November 2020 and passed it to the Chamber of Deputies, the lower house, for review and approval. Since the deadline of December 15, 2020, was fast approaching, the Chamber asked for its own extension. The Supreme Court granted it (until April 20, 2021) and the bill underwent significant changes before being approved by the Chamber on March 10, and so sent back to the Senate. The Senate certainly had enough time to review and either reject or accept the changes made by the lower house. That would have made this a shorter story. However, the Senate had other plans. Rather than approve the bill or request an additional extension, it simply did not do anything. Junes national midterm elections were approaching, and political calculations were made. The legislative process came to a standstill. Since the Senate did not approve the bill by the deadline, the Supreme Court basically did what it had mandated Congress to do. It activated a mechanism to guarantee rights that had only been undertaken once before in Mexican history: the General Declaration of Unconstitutionality (GDU). Continue in comments ",

The first half of that money is expected to be awarded by mid-August, Marijuana Regulatory Agency spokesman David Harns said. The Marijuana Regulatory Agency declined to reveal how many researchers submitted proposals by the July 16 deadline and has disclosed little else about the selection process. The decision is being made by a joint evaluation committee comprised of appointees from the Marijuana Regulatory Agency, the Michigan Department of Military and Veterans Affairs and the Department of Health and Human Services. Harns wouldnt identify the appointees or who selected them. The (Marijuana Regulatory Agency) approaches its work in a very transparent manner; there is no reason to think that that wont be the case with the Veteran Marijuana Research Grant Program, Harns said. As soon as the Joint Evaluation Committee finishes its review of the proposals and awarding of the grants, well be sharing that information publicly. MLive submitted a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) records request for copies of the proposals, but the request was denied. The Marijuana Regulatory Agency in its denial cited a Michigan law, MCL 18.1261(13)(a), which exempts such bids, quotes and proposals from release until after theyve been awarded. As an award notification has not yet been issued in this instance, the requested records/information cannot be released at this time, the FOIA denial read. Please note, however, that the requested information will be made available at a later date. The lack of up-front transparency by the state has some people on edge. I hope that they will do the right thing. Theyve done the right thing so far. We have great hopes for the future, said Chuck Ream, the Ann Arbor-based director of the Safer Michigan Coalition, a marijuana legalization advocacy group that helped secure the research funds. I wish they would release more information, but thats just because were so concerned.",

But unlike the failed 2015 legalization effort, they're not going to try to put it in the state Constitution. Instead, they have drafted a state law and plan to put it before legislators first before taking it to the voters. \"We think we have a proposal here that checks all the boxes,\" said Cleveland-area cannabis attorney Tom Haren, who is the spokesperson for the Coalition to Regulate Marijuana Like Alcohol. Supporters of the measure turned in an initial batch of more than 1,000 signatures and proposed language to the Ohio attorney general's office Tuesday. The attorney general has 10 days to review the summary of the proposed law that appears on petitions to make sure it is a \"fair and truthful\" representation of the measure. Supporters will eventually have to collect 132,887 signatures of registered Ohio voters to put the measure before the Legislature. Lawmakers will then have four months to pass, reject or pass an amended version of the statute. If they don't pass the bill, supporters can collect another 132,887 signatures to place it on a statewide ballot, likely in November 2022. What the bill would do The proposal would allow Ohioans age 21 and older to buy and possess 2.5 ounces of cannabis and 15 grams of concentrates and grow up to six plants in secure spaces at home, according to language of the proposed bill. A 10% tax would be applied, with proceeds going to local municipalities with marijuana businesses, substance abuse and addiction programs and operations for the program. Local governments could prohibit or limit marijuana businesses from locating in their communities. The language grandfathers in the existing medical marijuana program and allows the state's existing 34 cultivators, 47 processors and 58 dispensaries to obtain licenses for the recreational market almost exclusively for the first two years.

You can make it a million dollars, I don't think it's going to stop people from smoking, said Alderperson Bill Galvin. Galvin requested to look at the issue. The retired police officer had a constituent ask him to propose decriminalization. It makes no sense to have it on the books and not enforce it, said Galvin. According to the city attorneys office, the default cost for a pot possession fine in Green Bay used to be $880, a $650 citation plus court costs. A vote to lower the fine in 2018 brought the default cost down to $502. I know the judge is willing to work with people to make payments and that, but it still seems to me kind of ridiculous that we're charging the equivalent of some people a week or more of salary, said Galvin. At a city committee meeting, Alderperson John VanderLeest expressed opposition to lowering the fine amount. I think as far as reducing the fees, we might want to look at more education methods, not reducing fines, said VanderLeest. VanderLeest also requested a look at the number of citations being issued, something police said they will make available. Continue in comments ",

Patients who used CBD products also better tolerated epilepsy medications, used fewer prescription medications overall and experienced reduced psychiatric symptoms such as anxiety, the study found. No significant differences in seizure control were observed between patients who used CBD and those who did not, but the studys authors noted that both groups included a high number of individuals with no past month seizures. These findings further emphasize the need for controlled research to determine optimal CBD product types, doses, and concomitant use of other medications that maximize possible clinical benefit while minimizing potential risks, the report says. The study, Cross-sectional and longitudinal evaluation of cannabidiol (CBD) product use and health among people with epilepsy, was published Tuesday. It focuses specifically on what authors call artisanal CBDalternatives to the prescription drug Epidiolex, which the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved in 2018 to treat certain rare types of epilepsy. Pharmaceutical CBD is currently a restricted prescription medication, and insurance coverage is often limited to only those patients with the specific approved indications, the report says. As a result, a large number of patients with epilepsy elect to use alternative CBD products sold widely as dietary supplements by commercial vendors. The research was funded by Realm of Caring, a nonprofit foundation devoted to cannabinoid therapies that is sponsored by companies that make CBD products. The group conducted the study in collaboration with researchers at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. Continue in comments ",

Otherwise known as Weeds Little Brother, Delta-8 THC, or D-8, is the hottest cannabinoid on the market right now, especially in states like North Carolina, where marijuana remains illegal. We started selling our first Delta-8 brand in November, and it blew up, said Tanya Durand, owner of The Hemp Store on Franklin Street in Chapel Hill, in an interview with WRAL TechWire. The response has definitely been overwhelming. Not to be confused with the Delta COVID variant, Delta-8 is the less-potent, less well-known cousin of Delta-9 THC, the chief psychoactive compound in marijuana. Yes, it gets you high. Chill, mellow, or clear headed are some of the words used to describe the effect.  Some estimates put it at about 80% less strong than marijuana.  Delta-8 does not produce the side effects of paranoia or anxiety. Unlike Delta-9, which comes from marijuana, Delta-8 is derived from hemp. Hemp is part of the same Cannabis family, shares a similar chemical structure, looks like marijuana to the untrained eye and has a skunky odorsbut contains less than 0.3 percent of psychoactive tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). Another big difference: unlike Delta-9, which is currently banned under federal law, Delta-8 is legalin theory. Thanks to a loophole in the 2018 Farm Bill that legalized hemp and its derivatives, proponents argue its just another form of hemp and lawful.  Its currently available in most states, including North Carolina, where the Delta-8 business is expanding. Thats been our biggest sales for this year, really, said Durand. Almost overnight, vape shops are stocking shelves with Delta-8 gummies, tinctures and concentrates, ranging in price from $3 for a single serve to $40 for a bag of 20 gummies. Continue in comments ",

In 1995, 2% of schizophrenia diagnoses in the country were associated with cannabis use disorder. In 2000, it increased to around 4%. Since 2010, that figure increased to 8%, the study found. \"I think it is highly important to use both our study and other studies to highlight and emphasize that cannabis use is not harmless,\" said Carsten Hjorthj, an associate professor at the Copenhagen Research Center for Mental Health and an author of the study published in the medical journal JAMA Psychiatry, via email. \"There is, unfortunately, evidence to suggest that cannabis is increasingly seen as a somewhat harmless substance. This is unfortunate, since we see links with schizophrenia, poorer cognitive function, substance use disorders, etc,\" Hjorthj wrote. Previous research has suggested that the risk of schizophrenia is heightened for people who use cannabis, and the association is particularly driven by heavy use of the drug. Many researchers hypothesize that cannabis use may be a \"component cause,\" which interacts with other risk factors, to cause the condition. \"Of course, our findings will have to be replicated elsewhere before firm conclusions can be drawn,\" Hjorthj continued. \"But I do feel fairly confident that we will see similar patterns in places where problematic use of cannabis has increased, or where the potency of cannabis has increased, since many studies suggest that high-potency cannabis is probably the driver of the association with schizophrenia.\" Around the world tens of millions of people use cannabis. It's legal for recreational use in 19 US states and Canada. In these and some other places, it's also approved to treat some medical conditions. Cannabis use and cannabis use disorder have been increasing in Denmark, the study said -- a pattern that's also seen globally. Recreational weed use is illegal in Denmark but is allowed for medicinal purposes. Continue in comments ",

Demand had inexplicably spiked, swelling to three and half times normal. Water mains broke open, and storage tanks were drawn down to dangerous levels.

We said, Holy cow, whats happening? said Anish Saraiya, public works deputy for Los Angeles County Supervisor Kathryn Barger.  It took a while for officials to figure out where all that water was going: Water thieves  likely working for illicit marijuana operations  had pulled water from remote filling stations and tapped into fire hydrants, improperly shutting off valves and triggering a chain reaction that threatened the water supply of nearly 300 homes. As drought grips most of California, water thievery across the state has increased to record levels. Bandits in water trucks are backing up to rivers and lakes and pumping free water they sell on a burgeoning black market. Others, under cover of darkness, plug into city hydrants and top up. Thieves also steal water from homes, farms and private wells, and some even created an elaborate system of dams, reservoirs and pipelines during the last drought. Others are MacGyvering break-ins directly into pressurized water mains, a dangerous and destructive approach known as hot-tapping.  In Mendocino County, the thefts from rivers and streams are compromising already depleted Russian River waterways. In one water district there, thefts from hydrants could compromise a limited water supply for fighting fires, which is why they have put locks on hydrants. Any way that you can imagine that somebody is going to grab water, theyre doing it, said Mendocino County Sheriff Matt Kendall. For goodness sakes, everybody knows what is going on.

                "caption": "President Joe Biden still opposes marijuana legalization, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Wednesday, putting him at odds with Democratic leadership on Capitol Hill as it advances legislation to end the federal prohibition on pot. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer unveiled draft legislation Wednesday that would legalize marijuana as well as expunge non-violent criminal records related to marijuana. Schumer's proposal, cosponsored by Sens. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) and Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) would allow states to decide whether or not to legalize the drug. Asked about the majority leader's proposal, Psaki told reporters at her Wednesday press briefing that Bidens stance on marijuana legalization hasnt changed. The president has previously supported marijuana decriminalization, but hasnt gone so far as to support legalization. I have spoken in the past about the presidents views on marijuana, Psaki told the White House press corps, adding, nothing has changed. Theres no new endorsements of legislation to report today. Asked again about cannabis later in the briefing, Psaki said she hadnt spoken with the president about this specific piece of legislation  but again reiterated that Bidens position hasnt changed. The president has spoken about mass incarceration in the past, saying during his campaign that marijuana offenses shouldnt land Americans in jail. But the White House also made headlines for firing staffers early in Bidens term for marijuana use, earning the president criticism from marijuana legalization advocates. Schumer called the cannabis legislation \"one of the high priorities\" for Democrats in an interview with NBC, saying the party has a \"lot of top priorities\" that it needs to move forward on. The New York senator has long promised a vote on marijuana reform, though holdouts in his own party might make it difficult for the bill to pass in the Senate. Asked if Democrats have the votes to get this done, Schumer said they're working on it. In the interview, Booker said there is an urgency to pass this legislation, citing Americans who are \"seeing their lives destroyed and hurt\" as a result of of stringent marijuana laws. ",

                "caption": "A marijuana processing facility in Bay City had its license suspended indefinitely by the Michigan Marijuana Regulatory Agency on Monday. Based on its investigation of the conduct alleged in the formal complaint, the (agency) determined that the safety or health of patrons or employees is jeopardized by continued operation, the suspension order said. The facility is operated by MEDFarms, which is listed in state records as 3843 Euclid LLC, and operates Dispo, a marijuana retailer at the same address, 3843 Euclid in Bay City. The suspension comes after the state on July 8 announced the recall of 10,000 marijuana-infused chocolate edibles sold under the brand name Covert Cups. Regulators said a compliance check discovered improperly packaged product that wasnt accompanied by labels to confirm it had been entered into the states test tracking system, called METRC. The Michigan Marijuana Regulatory Agency also noted evidence of other safety and production violations, including video footage of an employee repeatedly licking her gloved finger and a spatula used in production of the chocolates. Investigators said they found product in non-retail packaging inside 21 unmarked bins in a safe room vault area and witnessed employees violating good manufacturing practices by wearing street clothes and using cellphones while wearing sanitary gloves. Some of the finished product that was identified as having already passed state safety compliance testing was never made available during the random sampling process, according to the Marijuana Regulatory Agency. Ryli Kant, a spokesperson for MEDFarms, said the business is frustrated by the state response and doesnt understand why regulators are portraying the company in such a negative light when there was no real safety concern. Due to a packaging shortage, Kant said some of the chocolate edibles were in temporary containers, but had all passed testing. This isnt the first compliance issue for 3843 Euclid LLC. Its license was suspended for 14 days last summer after the state found employees were licking pre-rolled joints to seal them closed with saliva as its normal practice. Continue in comments ",

Smoked a little before to calm my nerves lol but then the second we jumped out of the boat onto a kayak... i just could not wait to explore.

In fact, it's one of the best plants for use in bioremediation, aka the healing of soil with plants.  How is this possible? Hemp extracts toxins and pollutants from the soil and groundwater and absorbs carbon dioxide (CO2) while accumulating the toxins in its tissues and root systems, all as it remains undamaged. Through bioremediation, hemp can eliminate toxins such as metals, pesticides, solvents, and petroleum from the earth without the need to remove any of the contaminated topsoil. This process helps produce a clean, balanced and nutrient-rich soil, which can then be safely used for agriculture or improving surrounding areas. From oil spills to Chernobyl and so much more, hemp can heal the earth! : @hudsonhemp",

Allowing my senses to lend hand in the reception of the experience. From the feel of the paper and texture of the body, to the flavor of a dry pull, down to the sight of the first light. Part of my process before I begin to smoke is getting a feel for the joint itself, gently rolling it between my fingers while feeling for the textures of the paper and consistencies in the body. This allows me to get an idea of what Im about to smoke and how the draw may be upon inhalation. I then like to take a few dry pulls to test the restrictiveness of the draw while also experiencing the natural flavor profile of the flower before combustion begins. I will usually take 3 to 5 pulls, exhaling through my nose and mouth. This allows me to taste more as it activates both olfactory and gustatory senses. Each step so far is typically done in a calm and relaxed setting, but the lighting of the joint is where I make sure to take the necessary time to ensure Ive done it correct. Rather than directly pulling flame into the body, I prefer too Toast the foot by allowing the flame to gently ignite the foot without allowing the flame to come in direct contact with it. This helps to preserve flavor by not overheating the flower while promoting a healthy burn line. The last thing I do after establishing a solid burn line is to Purge the joint before smoking begins. This is done by gently blowing into the joint from the smoking end. What this does is expel any stale smoke that may have been trapped in the body from ignition. It essentially clears the body of any potential flavor inhibiting factors before you fully begin to smoke. These are some of the things I enjoy doing, what are some of yours?  @roll_bmc",

I find a lot of calm and tranquility from rolling, almost ritualistic. But what I find truly astounding about the craft is that its rare that you find two individuals that will roll exactly alike. That to me is amazing. This is because we all develop our own style or way of rolling the more we see and learn from our environment. We all start from somewhere, usually learning the basic concepts of rolling. You put the flower in, you tuck it up, roll it, and smoke it. After getting familiar with the basics is when we can really start to deviate from the foundations of rolling. Little by little, we begin to tweak and adjust things in order to achieve a certain outcome. If that outcome isnt reached, then you adapt and adjust and try again. Approaching rolling with this mindset is how we learn and develop new techniques to implement as well as open ourselves to being more creative. What you see is not always how it has to be. You can roll anyway and anything that you want to, there are no rules to this game. When you start to push your limits and step outside of your comfort zone, you can really start to create some amazing things. Things such as what I like to call Fold Tech in which the paper is folded and layered in a way to create a sturdier mouthpiece. Or the Culebra joint, taking inspiration from the cigar industry is a braided joint that when deconstructed creates 3 warped and twisted joints! I encourage everyone to get to it and start creating! See what ideas your minds lead you to!",

                "caption": "When it comes to the action of Smoking, youll often hear me say that pace is important to the overall pleasantry of the experience. Smoking too fast can cause burn/draw issues, while smoking too slow may cause burnouts resulting in re-lighting. I often advise smokers to let the coal breathe in between hits to allow the coal temperature to normalize before taking the next draw. Another helpful technique that Ive picked up from Pipe Smoking is a technique called Breath Smoking. This differs from letting it Breathe because it is actually using your own breathing rhythm. This is helpful when smoking things like Donuts. Its not something I do the entire time, but the idea is to use your natural breathing pattern to train a slow, consistent, and relaxed cadence to the draw sequence. How it is typically done is by holding the mouthpiece around your lips to create a tight seal. You then begin breathing slowly through your nose. The suction created from the seal of your lips will start drawing in fine puffs of smoke. You then gently exhale through the nose, and as a result the smoke in your mouth gets passed back into the body of the joint. This is referred to as massaging smoke. Massaging the smoke can lead to a more complex development of flavors while it moderates the overall temperature which can enhance the flavor profile itself. I generally like to take 2-3 breaths, gently inhaling and exhaling through my nose, while massaging the smoke on each exhale. 2-3 breaths should generate enough smoke to saturate your palate to inhale. With time and practice, you will begin to notice the differences in flavor and temperature. The goal is to make each draw as effortless as breathing itself. Its takes patience, but you will notice the advantages in the long run. Its a whole Vibe in itself, give it a shot and see if you can master your breathing! By @roll_bmc",

We planted some @cremedecanna.ca auto flower seeds, as well as some of our Jamaican cannabis seeds from our Christmas trip years ago. Our tiny greenhouse is filling up so quickly we gifted two plants to friends so the remaining plants could get thicker and thicker with the extra space. . The first time I grew cannabis I didnt quite enjoy it. I felt nervous and unsure and like I needed a lot of input. Truthfully I still dont feel like growing my own is my path, but I get a lot more enjoyment watching the process now that its not a science project in a tent with lights I have to regulate and intense formulas for nutrients. Backyard harvests feel so natural, so innate, just like washing off and enjoying fresh grown fruits and veggies from your garden, curing and rolling up homegrown cannabis is such a full sensory pleasure. . Homegrown cannabis is often feared during the legalization process. If its allowed why would anyone go to a shop people worry. If customers can grow their own how will any cannabis company survive? The answer is laughable, as @karissapukas once pointed out: many of us learned to bake our own bread in the start of quarantine and yet how many of us still buy loaves at the store? I know I do. And the same goes for cannabis. Our backyard harvest is a treasure and a memory I love making every year. It doesnt replace the excitement of cannabis shopping and selecting new strains, methods and products! #worldreefers #homegrown #homegrow #growyourown #backyard #backyardgarden #cannabis #cannabisgarden #greenhousegrow",

Wed spend summer weekends camping with the motorcycle clubs on their runs. Wed see Big Bear Lake, Yosemite, Pescadero, and places I dont even remember the names of because it was long before I ever needed to read a map. . Im pretty sure Im mid tearing my fingernails up, I cant remember a time before I tore and bit my nails into bloody stumps. When I think about it now I see it as one of my earliest cries for help, anxiety was consuming me, but stumpy nails dont seem like much of an emergency to adults. Instead I was often scolded, yelled at, punished for being caught picking my nails again. I learned to hide my hands often, to not ask for help with my feelings, to feel embarrassed of the physical consequences that my anxiety cost me. . I love this photo my step sister sent me, because its helped me forgive myself at that age. I deserved to be cared for instead of shamed, I forgive myself for hurting my body when my brain was hurting me. I didnt know any other way, and the people that cared for me didnt do a lot of caretaking for my emotions or needs beyond the legal basics. Food and shelter, though no dresser or even a blanket or bed of my own at a home I lived at half my life. No drawer of my own belongings, no space for me to exist, so often I would tear myself apart in every effort to disappear. . I love this picture my step sister sent me because it reminds me she was there. Sometimes I push away memories of these years so completely I miss out on the sweet small moments I got to share with my step siblings. The jokes theyd crack to bring a smile to my face, the fearlessness they showed mocking my father. Their mom comforting me, telling me its ok to cry. They made space for me to simply exist as I am, sensitive and empathetic, and they didnt fault me for my traits but just made space for them. I couldnt recognize at the time how powerful and loving that is, but Im so grateful I got to experience it. Im so lucky to always be their little sister.",

My  #heuschkelianavariegata plant died a slow death after I treated it for pests a couple months ago with End All spray by Safer Brand. The name is a bit ironic since it actually ended the plant along with the pests, and wasnt really safe at all lol (0 out of 10, do not recommend). It killed all the other Hoyas I treated on that same day, too. UGH. The leaves and stems completely dried out and they slowly died. I tried to save them but nothing worked. It was awful. The good news is that I have a baby plant I propagated from her a while back. I never treated her with the poison spray so shes still happy and okay! I just hope she will grow to be as big and beautiful as her mama someday  #hoya #hoyalove #ripplant",

In less than 3 weeks, hundred have been convicted of crimes and sent to maximum security prisons where they are treated horribly by Cuban officials. Their official crime is labeled under spreading COVID-19 of which no pro-government protestors were arrested of when they showed their patriotism to the revolution in the days following.

All of us in tje international community who have been protesting and waving our Cuban flags have the obligation to now pressure the cuban government in releasing ALL POLITICAL PRISONERS.

I can only imagine what its going to be like when the others start laying again, Ive got used to the quiet! I havent had eggs here for months and thats just how I like it. Chickens naturally have a break from producing eggs, all their energy goes into growing new feathers after their moult and coping with the cold weather. Eggs are seasonal and real treasures, an added bonus when you keep chickens.  #aussiechickens #herechookchook #cottagegarden #freerangechickens #poules #galline #hns  #hhner #galinhas #abcmyphoto #gardeningaustralia",

Were listening. Were absorbing an objects lines, a parks multicolored leaves.  If were taking a photo of ourselves, were seeing ourselves. Really seeing. Were listening, too. Were acknowledging. It is in the acknowledging of ourselves that self-care becomes part of selfies.  We are often encouraged and trained to turn our focus outward.  We see the beauty and goodness in others and care for and nurture for them.  But self-care is about turning that compassionate focus inward and acknowledging the beauty and goodness within us.

Every single part of the hemp plant can be repurposed into something else. None of it has to go to waste. The stalk can be turned into paper, rope, insulation, animal bedding, or textiles. The seeds can be used as a dietary supplement, fuel, granola, or beer. The roots are great for compost and mulch. The leaves can be used to make CBD! Many things that you already use every day can be made from hemp. It is a very versatile plant, and it is also a very low maintenance plant to grow. https://thoughtcloud.net/hemp-oils-seeds-uses-and-benefits/ #hemp #hempplant #hempflower #hempseeds #naturalremedies #cbdoil #cbdlife #cbdhealth  #cbdproducts #cbdinformation #hempoil #cbdbenefits #cbd #cbdwellness #thoughtcloud #herthoughtcloud",

We have all heard about CBD sports drinks and CBD Energy Shots packed with minerals and vitamins that have boosted athletic performance and can help you stay hydrated and fuel your workout. Apart from its extensive range of therapeutic advantages, this cannabinoid can also hugely benefit your body to prepare for and recover from exercise. Most vitally, CBD is anti-inflammatory. It interacts with the bodys endocannabinoid system (a system built to improve balance throughout the body) to decrease the accumulation of chemicals that cause inflammation. This property endows CBD with the potential to offer relief within exercise recovery.

This particular Bahama S1 pictured was very close to the rugged cut in structure but varied in smell carrying a faint creamy grape smell with a prominent fruity sweetness. People may think we are crazy for giving away so many Bahamas, but honestly at the end of the day its a thank you. A thank you to @jenndoe420 and @ruggedrootsinc for their selection, a thank you to all of you who waited and supported this drop from the start, and finally a thank you to the new gardeners who may have just found us and are giving us a shot for the first time. We appreciate you and hope you enjoy this line-up as much as we did growing it! We hope that taking the time, testing and showing you every strain and explaining in detail what we observed  during our test sets a higher expectation of what you deserve as gardener. With that said if anyone has any questions about the drop or want to chat live with the team Well be in discord for the next couple hours (found in bio).

Ever since Runtz has came on the scene breeders have been crossing everything under the sun with it and we almost left it out of this line up for that reason alone. We know from all the Runtz crosses that we have ran that about 80% or so will smell just like Runtz and then the other 20% or so seem to take on the other parents characteristics. Of course this is just our limited observation but going into this Bahama cross we decided that if we didnt add to the Runtz by either making more unique or overall better in some way it wasnt making the cut, that was our mindset. Our Bahama Bussdown performed how we thought, dominant for Runtz smell but the majority of the phenos were much more dense in structure, almost all had sandy frost rather than greasy and the 20% or so group of outliers had a very unique fruity addition to the terp profile all of that with the purple and pink colorways made the decision to add the Bahama Bussdown an easy one.  Now that we have done our final reveal please look over the last 8 posts and let us know which is your favorite of the line up and let us know below !!! Have a fun and safe weekend!!!

We didnt think much of it, got her back to Seattle and threw her in the flower room with the other potential candidates. Our rule of thumb pertaining to cuts given to us is simple. It doesnt matter what the name of the cut is or where it supposedly came from, until its grown out by us and found worthy it doesnt get bred and thats that. Even if Luke Skywalker himself glided down lightsaber in hand and bestowed us a cut proclaiming its the best cut in the universe that cut is still getting grown out. So as for the back ground on the Yoda all we can confirm is it was handed to us as Yoda and its the gassiest cross in the lineup. The phenos the cross produced for us came in two general forms. First, the one pictured which is a Bahama dominant frost monster with a gassy fruity pine mint smell and breakthrough pink hues. The next pheno we saw quite a bit of was short with no pink, more of a grey blue in color, frosty as hell and all gas zero fruit. The Mando is geared toward all the gas goblins who need that fuel flavored flower. Its thick frost and unique pink hues really make it pop in the garden. We found it fun to grow even though some of the more blue grey phenos seemed to lag early on they caught right up and finished strong in later flower. This brings us to seven reveals with only 1 more to go before the grand finale on the first!!  Thank you for tuning in and participating in this drop with your comments and likes.

Bitties is a cross between the Jigglers cut selected by @exoticgenetix_mike and The Bahama Mama. The Jigglers brought the amazingly loud and unique red pop gelato terps to the table while the Bahama Mama lended her structure and frost. We saw both greasy and sandy frost consistency. Both parents are dominant for dark coloration so it was no surprise we saw absolutely no green phenos. The Bahama also lowered the leaf to flower ratio making this stacker a trimmers dream.  We kept ALOT of phenos to run again. One of which we named the Blockhead cut that grew stinky purple softballs with almost no leaves, a really a fun one to grow, it just took everything we threw at it and loved it.

Todays reveal is a combination of collaborative art. We first approached local graffiti artist @creaturepanic about doing box art for us months ago, I had no idea who @creaturepanic was I just knew I always saw this crazy squiggly bear everywhere in Seattle and every time I spotted one it was almost a wheres Waldo type of moment, Id have to point it out like theres another one! With some digging we found @creaturepanic and they were stoked to do some box art for us. Cultivation and graffiti in a weird way are very similar, both are forms of artistic subculture thats not fully accepted by everyone but part of the creative patchwork that makes up the American experience. In this box you will get two pieces of Seattle art, ours and theirs.

This cross crushed it in the test, bringing vivid deep purple colors coated with a thick candy shell like frost bearing a distinctive gritty sandy feel which may suggest a possible washer. Her strongest quality is her over powering strawberry smell, weve grown many strawberry scented plants and this cross exceeded our expectations which is exactly why she deserved to be part of this line up.

This drop took us over a year to create with collaborative partnerships from fellow breeders, growers and artists from around the country. Our focus was clear with this line up in that we wanted to create something beautiful, fun to grow and distinctively different. We personally took the time to test, grow and subsequently selected every strain on this menu so that we are absolutely confident you will find the winners you deserve. The Bahama Mama selection that we reversed came to us from @ruggedrootsinc and performed exactly how we had hoped adding structure, frost and amazing colors to everything it touched. We have decided that its so special that the Bahama S1 (full 6 pack) will be the exclusive freebie for the Bahama lineup for the first month (Aug 1 -31) As we get closer to the Aug 1 drop we have other surprises but for now let us know below which of the crosses you wanna see first, we have pictures of everything and we cant wait to share them with you!  . #BahamaMama2021 #risewiththepheonix #solfirefamily #testedandtrusted #craftedwithlove",

Prior to losing him, we always said we would do what it took to make it out of the cycle of violence in DC. Thankfully I had basketball to save me, but he didnt. To this day, I know hes watching down on me and thats what fuels me. Ill never stop using the game of basketball to inspire others to follow their dreams.

Remember that self-soothing is a skill we all need as adults because it allows us to be responsible for our inner-world and ask for what we need in a way that others can truly meet us. If we test, push or demand when we are hurt or triggered, we will self sabotage and then feel wronged by those we are in relationship with when they inevitably move away from us. Its also important to self-soothe because we wont always have someone who can be there for us, but we can hold ourselves and connect to spirit in every moment. Also, if we rely solely on others to rescue us from our big emotions, we will inevitably self-abandon or even move toward unsafe people because we need them to feel secure. Healing relationship anxiety is a slow and gradual process of making your way home to your body, finding safety within and cultivating the capacity and language to create secure friendships, romantic partnerships and be whole within yourself.  @sheleanaaiyana",

We may feel so much resistance to the idea that our partners arent there to serve us. Why bother if they arent there to meet our needs? We may hear these truths in overly simplified terms and mistakenly interpret this to mean that any behaviour is acceptable behaviour. What this means is that while our partners may indeed bring joy and pleasure and support into our lives, their function is not to be for us. Conscious Relationship is a dance of togetherness and separateness. It is in recognizing our partner as an individual with a differently reality and emotional lens than us. It is in learning to let go of control, criticism, blame and to step into recognition. Recognition that our partners can never check all of our boxes, meet 100% of our needs or be in sync with us at all times. Conscious Relationship is challenging because if we are really on the path to awakening, we will inevitably see just how attached we are to our partners being a certain way, or the relationship matching our fantasy version of how we want it to look. We grow together when we loosen our grip and soften to reality. When we can truly live in those hard to live places. When we can encourage freedom and trust in spite of our wounds that tell us not to. This is the journey. It is long and messy, hard and beautiful and all things in between.  @sheleanaaiyana",

Our power is not in attempting to manipulate the timeline, rush a transformation or in trying to extract the lessons as fast as possible. Our power is found in the moments of deep surrender - opening to nothingness and making room for the medicine to do its work. These things take time, grief is transformative on its own timeline. Taking time to let truth find its way to you is the medicine. Resting when you want to run is the medicine. Trusting when you want to resist is the medicine. Its ok to move slowly, its ok not to know. Its ok to just be. Nothing lasts forever, and for now, this is your process.  @sheleanaaiyana",

It is about learning to use our energy correctly and channel it into the right places rather than leaking it out or trying to offload it onto others. It's a dance of the elements and honouring our unique medicine for the world. When we are healing, we may fall into the trap of thinking there are parts of our being that need to be tucked away, but usually the elements that we struggle most with are also our medicine in this life. For those of us who have a lot of fire  energy, we know this element can express in destructive ways - lashing out, blaming, walling off and pushing people away. The natural response is to try to put out the fire - to see it as the problem. But your fire and anger is also your medicine. We dont want to put it out, we want to learn how to stoke and tend to it while bringing in other elements to soften it. We need fire, it is the energy of passion, leadership, dedication, resilience, protection, boundaries and transformation. If we struggle with anger and feel shame or guilt for having it or expressing it from a wounded place, our practice is to learn how to let our fire be a guiding light for others instead of burning everything down. Our tendency when were working with a behaviour or pattern that feels sticky is to want to eliminate that part of ourselves all together. To get rid of our fire, get rid of our sadness, get rid of our anger. But it is through welcoming these aspects of our nature, that we heal. Building an altar that represents the elements you want to call in and cultivate more of is a beautiful way to connect to spirit and honour your process. Build an Elemental Altar  Place a candle or other object on the altar that represents your fire or the reactive pattern you want to soften. Next to it, place a bowl or cup of water to represent your tenderness, depth and vulnerability. Bring in a flower to represent softening, opening and transformation. Remember all parts of you are loveable, and the very thing youre battling may eventually be the energy you learn to channel as your gift.  @sheleanaaiyana  Dress from the beauties at @flookthelabel  @allypintucci",

If so, you might experience fear or panic when a person moves away from you energetically, needs space or time alone, doesnt reply quickly to texts or communicates less than you - and most of the time - this will be true. Your anxiety may tell you they are the problem, that they need to change their behaviour or do something to help you feel better And while there are often things for a partner to work on, theres a hidden gift for you in these moments where you feel like you need saving and they dont do what you want them to do While youre hyper-focused on getting something from them, the real healing lies in your ability to learn how to stay in your body and feel your way through intense moments rather than ejecting immediately and grasping for a life raft in the form of your lover. What youll find if you slow down and return to your body is that you are safe and that its ok to feel what youre feeling. The inner-child in you has a message for you, so dont abandon them, listen gently and pour your love into the sensitive and tender being that lives within your own heart. Learning to self-soothe doesnt mean becoming needless or never receiving support. All humans need this, touch and connection are vital. It simply means youll have the capacity to stay connected to yourself and trust your ability to navigate big emotions. It also means you will be able to set and protect boundaries rather than chasing love in the wrong places because you are afraid to be in your own body. This skill is vital to ending self-abandonment and reclaiming your wholeness.  What questions do you have about anxious attachment and self-soothing?  @sheleanaaiyana",

Sadness, loss, grief often what we find beneath the surface is a fear that if we surrender to the feeling underneath our anxiety we may be swallowed by the oceanic force of our pain and never find our way back. But pain is a passage not a prison. Its safe to surrender and allow yourself to go deep within. Often when we are overcome with anxiety its because we are resisting our reality - maybe we know we need to let go but we wish it werent so perhaps everything is changing and we dont want to accept it breathe, return to your heartbeat, return to your body.  Oceanic Visualization + Somatic Practice for Anxiety  Place a hand on your heart and belly, feel the rise and fall of your breath. Notice the sensations arising in your body - in your chest, legs, arms, face. Name them - tingle, tight, cool, warm etc. Now return to your breath - is it heavy or shallow, simply notice. Now go to the anxious energy in your body - where is it located? Does it have a shape, color? If the anxiety had words for you - what would it say? Listen quietly, dont overthink or script - simply allow your anxiety to do its job and serve as a messenger. When you receive the message, perhaps you already know what emotion is present - you can also inquire and ask whats the feeling underneath this anxious feeling? Perhaps its sadness, fear, abandonment, loss let it be for a moment and stay with your body. Theres no need to run or shut down this feeling, you are safe to go deeper. Visualize gentle ocean water washing over you, with each wave, imagine your body being held and cleansed. With each wave washing over you, imagine that you are giving your sadness to the waters and letting them heal you. With hands on your heart, thank your body for carrying you, your heart for beating, your breath for giving you life. Slowly return to the space you are in, feel your feet or back planted on the earth, look around at your surroundings and say my body is a safe place all of my emotions and sensations are welcome. Sending you so much love    @sheleanaaiyana",

                "caption": "Creating safety is at the root of our ability to heal. We cannot heal if we are in a triggered stage and we cannot heal if we are in an environment thats rife with judgment, criticism and volatility. While honesty and truth are vital to any healthy relationship, without gentleness and compassion our truth is nothing more than a product of our own ego. All of our wounding from relationship occurs as a result of being left to tend to our pain alone - without connection, compassion or understanding. We learn to wall off, hide, defend, numb or mask up - but ultimately underneath it all there is fear and a nervous system thats stuck in a pattern as if the original injury is still happening. This is why creating safety is the priority when it comes to our healing work. Our bodies need to be safe in order for pain to move through and out, and we need to co-regulate with other healthy and securely attached nervous systems to transform. Individualistic healing work and teachings are on the mark when it comes to recognizing that we must heal ourselves to heal the world, but it cannot be done without the healing power of relationship - friendship, community, romantic - all are flavours of connection that have the power to wound us and to heal us. Learning to listen, to empathize, to validate anothers reality, and to genuinely care for each other becomes easier when we are not deprived of this ourselves. Questions about safety? @sheleanaaiyana",

It shows the pain point running under the surface of our lives (core wound) and yet it also shows our greatest opportunity for growth in this lifetime. It represents our deepest gift to others and the world. Once we discover how to unlock it and alchemize it, it becomes the key to our highest potential. No one is exempt from the challenge of Chiron, or the gifts once unlocked. You can look up your Chiron at cafeastrology.com Check the house first and the sign second. Scroll through the slides to read about your Chiron house and sign+ If you want to learn more about how to read charts for yourself and others - the doors for our new Become Your Own Astrologer Course are officially open. More on our website or in bio link.Andrea is not only one of my dearest friends, shes the COO of Rising Woman AND writes our astrology reports. Shes been doing readings for me for years and I have deep admiration for the way she layers multiple methods together to create an extremely accurate reading. We also made sure to weave in trauma informed teachings into this program so that you can learn how to be extra mindful and nuanced with how you read a chart for someone else, as this is a very sacred responsibility! Which is also why Andrea believes everyone should have the ability to understand their own charts if they have the desire to learn. Thus, Become Your Own Astrologer was born! Sending you lots of love today beauties, @sheleanaaiyana",

So far 18 villages have been evacuated and 35 aircrafts, 457 vehicles, and 4,000 personnel have been involved in the firefighting efforts, as separate wildfires raged in the provinces of Osmaniye, Kayseri, Kocaeli, Adana, Mersin and Kutahya.

What should you do while youre there? - Angels Landing / The Narrows - these are both incredibly popular hikes for a good reason. Ive done both several times. Start EARLY! - Explore the east side of Zion. Less visitors, no shuttles and more access. Ive spent so much time on this side of the park in the last year and loved every second of it. - Go canyoneering. I cant believe I spent 6 years in Utah before trying this and I already cant wait to do it again. - Explore the areas just outside the park. The amazing scenery doesnt end with the park boundaries. In fact, the nearby options often bring much smaller crowds and really impressive views.\" - @andreafcannon, Diamond Medallion Member Have Zion recs to add to our list? Leave them below ",

Much more than gratitude, I really thought I could use if any, influence that I have to share... about something that is from my heart. No facade, no cinematic angles, just the real genuine message from deep within. This achievement might have been phenomenal but what will be even more, I guess is using this milestone for a better purpose.  This took me a lot of courage to craft this and share it openly out here, it is a message about vulnerability, purpose, the heart to everything we do.

Can we talk for a sec?? ;) Have yall ever found yourselves in situations where you genuinely want to be happy for someone else but for some reason feelings of jealously overtake you?? Well Ive totally been there!! And let me tell you, not only is it the worst, but its also a trap. There is a unique plan, a calling, an individual purpose for YOUR life that was placed over you when God created you. There is something inside of you that this world needs, something that nobody else has but YOU. Every little detail about you, the way you look, your personality, the things you love, were all intentionally placed inside of you to help fulfill this purpose. Crazy right??  Can you guess what the first thing is that stops us from walking in our individual callings and ultimately living a fulfilling life? Focusing and trying to walk in someone elses!! Only when we walk in our own callings will we feel truly fulfilled. When we realize that not only are we each individually chosen by God & that He has a plan for each of our lives, but that someone elses success doesnt hinder ours, we become unstoppable!! Because only then can comparison end, and celebration begin!!! Our gifts compliment one another and make us powerful!! We need each other  Tag someone youre proud of to celebrate them ",

Were not saying you cant travel with your guns. Were just saying that they need to be unloaded and securely packed inside of a proper gun case and either checked as a stand-alone item or included in your other checked bags.  We see this at airports every day, and almost every time we hear I didnt know it was there. Nobody wants to be *that* person, holding up the security lines because theyve left a gun in their bag. Plus, there are some pretty serious penalties associated with trying to sneak a weapon on a plane. So just dont.  Any questions about traveling with guns?

I left in complete awe learning of this natural wonder  Considered to be one of the longest lava tubes on our planet from a single volcano  Attenborough named this place the 8th wonder of the world. This landscape was formed by immense volcanic activity over 190,000 years ago. Undara is an Indigenous word meaning long way. The Lava tubes were formed by a molten lava flow cooling and solidifying on the outside. Surrounded by rich, red volcanic basalt soils, nature has now reclaimed this landscape, covered in a sea of native savannah grasses, concealing the hidden lava tubes below the earths surface.  We witnessed these volcanic craters from above in the sky and below we wandered underground within the depths of the lava tube structures  A truly fascinating experience to learn about the incredible natural history of this region and the magic of Mother Nature. @undaraexperience @queensland @britzcampervans #thisisqueensland #exploreTNQ  Ewamian Country",

We spent all the money we had back then on a little camper that we lived in for 4 months. It was the pictures we took with that van that got our Instagram started  We fell in love with the free lifestyle of being able to wake up in a different spot everyday, park next to the ocean and have picnics and nights under the stars  Now we are here in 2021 and although a lot has changed for us, I guess somethings never change  swipe to see how we started  #vanlife #adventurelife #kaptenandson #bekapten #vanlifedistrict #livingvanlife #vanlifers #vanlifeexplorers #camperlife #vanlifegermany #oldtimes #lovers #couples #europetrip #mariefeandjakesnow",

The whole setting up went surprisingly smooth without any issue thanks to the highly professional Dark Mofo crew.  The entire audiovisual content was produced before real setting up - we spent two weeks in a warehouse in Saint Petersburg with a similar sound system, full tables of modular synthesizers, and visualizer.  It was a new experience for us - never had the ability to deeply focus on sound and light for such a large-scale setup rather than counting hours before running the show. So great thanks to Dark Mofo for believing in us!

More to come when we can manage time but till then I hope youre enjoying and I hope you and your ohana (family) are healthy and enjoying the incredible little and big moments in life.  I enjoy working 7 days a week, but I find its helpful to take random moments to find the smallest thing to be extra amazed and extremely grateful for, to consciously appreciate something a little more fully, and that makes the challenging parts of work easier too. Perspective is powerful, I appreciate what Ive experienced while traveling or working abroad,  to know how fortunate I am to have the rights, choices, and access to basic necessities that many people in the world dont have.  Sometimes that small moment of conscious gratitude is for being able to switch on a light switch or readily have access to clean drinking water, which is actually pretty huge.  I hope wherever you are you have that.  Have a great night.

It is because of those individual sharks and other marine creatures that my passion and drive to help save them is constantly renewed and why I share this information with the public and have trained so many other wonderful professionals @OneOceanDiving to be a voice for those without a voice, and to facilitate better interactions with the highest level of  awareness and experience through extensively applied techniques.  **Disclaimer** This information builds off the information in my online course which is a visual taster of my book (links in bio,) however, sharks are important apex predators that need and deserve to be respected as such, so please do not attempt to recreate this.  I share this information because I want people to be more knowledgable, aware, and as safe as possible when they have the incredible experience of enjoying time with sharks under the guidance of an extensively trained and experienced professional guide.  Speaking of extensively trained professional shark safety guides@OneOceanDiving is now hiring people who have an unwavering passion for marine conservation, shark-strong work ethic/grit, and a very positive attitude PADI Divemasters or PADI professional freedive instructors who ideally have a degree related to marine science. Dont worry, we teach you all about shark behavior and safety because there is no university or other course that will teach you this, but you do have to be exceptional in the water to pass the swim test, and very good at guiding other people in water.

A sharks gills are a very sensitive part of their body and generally Ill observe an abrupt bolt or movement away when another shark bumps, brushes, or rams (the behavioral term used for side body bumping without biting) another in this area.  Males will bite females around the pectoral area, sometimes on the gills, or even the dorsal when attempting to mate. He has his mouth closed so its more likely hes trying to displace her in a territorial dispute. Some species of female sharks actually have thicker skin than the males (like many female women .)  I love this slow motion clip watching them together. Even the other fish behavior and their expressions are so cute.  If you look close there is a 3rd tiger shark in the background.  Wondering how to tell male from female? Notice the difference of the sharks on the underside closer to the tail (also known as a caudal fin) the male on the right has two extra appendages called claspers behind his pelvic fins and before the anal fin and caudal fin.

Although surfing is an individual sport and Im the one holding the medal, its team work. I wish everyone in my corner could come up on the podium with me and have a piece of the medal. There are so many people around me that work countless hours and dedicate so much for me. You all know who you are, this is ours. To my family and friends, we did it! Words will never describe what this means to me and how proud I am to be able to show this medal and celebrate it. To my fellow competitors also, we did it! . Who would have thought we would be in the Olympics fighting for medals, Im so proud to be a surfer and I think we represented our sport well this week. Mission accomplished. love",

We had no idea how big this fish truly was until we got on some WIFI at the lodge and started doing some research. After speaking with @delphfishing and Raymond Douglas from @kingsailfishmounts and using the @bonefishtarpontrust tarpon weight calculator, we estimated that our fish was around 312lbs, beating the current world record by over 25lbs! We used a goggle eye for bait.

With a speckled, iridescent membrane, the aquatic animal is almost entirely transparentonly its optic nerve, eyes, and digestive tract are visible to humansand sightings like these are so infrequent that scientists previously resorted to studying the species only after pulling it from the stomachs of its predators.

By @_bugdreamer_ : Some invertebrates use a molecule called haemocyanin to carry oxygen around their bodies using copper atoms instead of iron. The colour comes from the copper atoms in the haemocyanin molecule, which is blue when it is carrying an oxygen atom. It is dissolved directly into their blood instead of being enclosed in blood cells.

By @jakewiltonphoto: Stumbling across an oily slick on the surface of the water with birds feeding in it we stopped to investigate. @ellemayell and I noticed a shimmering white thing on the bottom so we decided to get in the water to check. Sliding in revealed a humpback whale skeleton that had been completely devoured by sharks and other scavengers.. All the sharks had moved on by this time but it was an amazing sight to see! Western Australia has the largest population of migrating humpback whales in the world with Ningaloo Reef being one of the many places the breed and give birth. As the population increases scenes like this will become more common which is a bonus for the health of the ecosystem feeding the entire food chain from the bottom up. #whale #humpbackwhale #ningalooreef #ningaloo #australiascoralcoast #australia #australiangeographic #ocean #whalecarcass #feedingfrenzy #underwatervideo #underwaterphotography #diving #wildlife #sharks #humpbackwhales #whales #earthcapture #natgeo",

The sculptures are each made out of one of the very things that endanger their lives - long-line hooks. Through his powerful and gracious sculptures, Vincent Mock aims to raise awareness around the importance of these species for the health of the ocean, and for the wider future of our planet and humanity.  The center-piece in the collection, a 12-meter-long (39 ft) whale shark also made out of longline fish hooks is also on sale, with 100% of the profits from it's sale going to Sea Shepherd.

But we cant forget why were fighting! That's why we're always in need of sharp images showing marine wildlife in their natural habitats, and for shark week, what better focus to have than sharks?  That's why we're calling for photo donations of sharks to our photo donations platform.

We were in La Ventana and had gotten word that there had been Orcas around, so with @alexsharks_ we set off in two boats to see if we could find orcas or other pelagic species. As we searched we found a FAD, (Fish Aggregation Device) commonly used by fisherman, it attracts bait fish which in turn can attract larger fish, we jumped in the water to see if any fish were around, small bait fish at the surface. We did a deeper drop to about 70ft and to our horror saw this Mobula Mobular tangled and dead in this line. We brought it to the surface, cut the line and tried swimming it to see if there was any chance of some life in it, but it was too late. We let it's lifeless body sink into the ocean... Meanwhile the other boat found a milk jug moving fast at the the surface, when they jumped in to look at it a pregnant female silky shark was attached to hook barely swimming, they were able to free it. These scenes are happening far too often, we are destroying our oceans and this must be stopped! .  @j.kowitz  . . . . . . . . . #mantaray #mantarays #underwaterlife #uw #oceanlife #underwater #underwaterworld #underthesea #oceans #theocean  #seacreatures #seaanimals #tourtheplanet #earthcapture #oceanlove #animalplanet #discoverwildlife #wildlifelovers #wildlifeshots #deepbluesea #diving #freediving #freedive #freediver #divinglife #divingtrip #dive #sealovers",

In between Hawaii and Kwaj we did a toxic gas drill, held some celestial navigation training, swim call, and crossed the International Date Line where we were visited by none other than DavyJones and Queen Neptune.  Once we got to Kwaj our engineers did a contactless fueling evolution and we had a morale night onboard. Corn hole tournament and Hawaiian shirt contest.

After repairs we left LA on May 19th and arrived to Honolulu, Hawaii on May 27th. This was our first longest leg of the patrol. Traveled over 2,000 nautical miles over eight days. We conducted a flooding drill and an astern refuel at sea with CGC JUNIPER. When not engaged in drills or refuels the crew played some games or took some personal time to overlook the amazing view at sea.  We were in Hawaii for almost two weeks for our quarterly Operationally Driven Maintenance Schedule (ODMS). While we were here our engineers, ETs and GM1 conducted maintenance on vital equipment to ensure we keep running. We also hosted D14 Commander and Command Master Chief, Rear Admiral Sibley and Master Chief Salls. Admiral Sibley was able to speak to the crew and also recognize some high performers.

It is my hope that sharing this information will help people to be safer while enjoying time with sharks but we want to give a strong disclaimer that people should not attempt to reproduce scenes from this series, this is for emergency reference and awareness only.The JAWSOME safety guides at @oneoceanDiving go through the most extensive and strenuous in-depth behavioral and applied training and if youre ever going diving purposefully with sharks please be respectful and go with an extensively experienced professional guide who works with sharks in-water full time.  @OneOceanDiving in unfortunatly losing one of its most amazing lady shark scientists because her husband is going to teach at a university on the mainland (congrats,) so we are hiring people with a deep passion for shark and marine conservation.Must also already have a PADI divemaster certification or PADI freedive instructor cert, GRIT, and ideally with a marine science or related degree.Apply by emailing the @OneoceanDiving office.  #NowHiring #WorkWithSharks #SharkJob #SharkDiver #SharkDiving #DiveWithSharks #LearnAboutSharks #OneOceanDiving #OneOcean #Ocean #Sharks #discoverSharks",

We generally only start to share this information with professional shark safety diver guides once theyve already been working with sharks on a daily basis for an extended period of time, only those who have the water skill required to quickly and efficiently move themselves in the water and adapt to a rapid approach and are trained to look in all directions continuously to see an approach or issue before it becomes a serious issue. As a photographer and videographer I want to get a stable shot but I wont compromise safety to get that shot, its not worth disrespecting the sharks and risking their reputation so if I need to be stable then I have @Oceanramsey of one of the professional shark safety divers weve trained watch my back.  I make deterring a large shark look easier than it is because Ive done it a lot in many places around the world with many species and Ive worked in the water daily for more than two decades specifically for water safety and mostly always focused around sharks.  So, please be respectful of them and stay safe, dont become complacent or assume every approach or shark species or location will be the same, it wont.  Special mahalo nui loa (thank you so much) to my love @OceanRamsey for filming me, being my safety, and demonstrating many of the techniques I talk about. Also special thank you to our amazing editor @Jarebutler for your incredible work.

In this video @oceanramsey gently deterred her away from the engines as much as possible along with our newest safety diver @hannahtuomistobell We are very happy and grateful to be visited by tiger sharks and get especially excited when its one of the ones we recognize from our @oneoceanresearch @oneoceansharks photo identification records. There are not that many tiger sharks and the larger ones like Nikki-Nik here tend to scare a lot of other sharks down deeper when they are around.  We see an increase in Tiger sharks after whale season ends and the water warms up so its just the start of our Tiger Shark season now.

It is a love that helps me feel proud of myself and always creates a safe space for me.  It sees me through my grief and fills me up so that I have the strength to fulfill my lifes divine purpose.  It is a very sleeved up and tatted love  I am so grateful for this love  #meandsomebodyson #blacklove #blacklovepage #blacklovecouples #blacklovematters",

He is always in control, and He always has much bigger plans for our lives than we can even imagine.  No doubt, Ill remember this point in my career forever. Not the fact that I didnt make the Olympic final or come home with an individual medal, but the fact that I gave it my all. That I didnt give up. That I finished what I started. I faced adversity at every turn this year, and at times, I didnt know if I would make it this far or if it was even worth putting myself out there to possibly fail. I didnt reach my goals this time around, but I didnt fail.  I can confidently say Im a champion! Not because of the medals Ive won but because of how Ive consistently fought for what I believe in, my perseverance, and my fiery passion to always be me! Im proud of Simone the 2X Olympian/5X Olympic medalist, but most importantly Im proud to just be ME Simone Ashley Manuel!  Time to rest up and heal my mind, body, and spirit!

As temperatures have soared and strong winds stoked the flames the past 3 days, killing at least 4 people along with 1,000+ farm animals and sending 60 more people to the hospital as their homes burned down. So far 18 villages have been evacuated and 35 aircrafts, 457 vehicles, and 4,000 personnel have been involved in the firefighting efforts, as separate wildfires raged in the provinces of Osmaniye, Kayseri, Kocaeli, Adana, Mersin and Kutahya. Turkey has battled a series of disasters caused by extreme weather conditions this summer, including flash floods last week that killed 6 people in the Black Sea region so please join us in praying for all the people and animals in these hard hit communities along with the brave firefighters and share this with your followers and friends  Via @karmagawa  #prayforturkey #wildfires #turkey",

Since Ive had a lot of fun sharing our life story in short highlight videos Ive perhaps given the unintended impression that its all been rainbows and kisses, and that marrying your first love is always a romantic and excellent idea. I regularly get messages from young people asking for relationship advice because they want what we have. So here are some of my personal truths and observations. Being right for each other is way more important than how old you are. If we hadnt met at such a young age I would rather have waited for him than commit to the wrong person. True love is worth waiting for. Part of true love is treating each other with the care and respect you both deserve. If you dont believe you deserve those things then take some time to fall in love with yourself first so you give off a vibe that attracts someone who agrees with you. Dont think you can change the wrong person into the right person. People can and do change, but only if they want to for their own reasons, not because someone else sees them as a fixer-upper. If youre going to commit to someone accept their imperfections too youre getting the whole package. Just as there are no perfect people there is no perfect marriage. Everyone struggles at times. Nobody owes anybody the painful parts of their story just know that everybody has them. Continued in comments...",

Although I may not have swum to the level I believe I was capable of, I realize my biggest wins and successes comes from moments like this. Im so fired up for whats to come! Too blessed to stress, and God is so good!  I have been working toward this dream with my family for the last 12 years. To my mom and dad, I would not be the Olympian I am today without you. Thank you for sacrificing everything to give me this incredible opportunity to display Gods gifts. To my sister Michaela, youre my best friend and youve seen me at my best and at my worst. I wouldnt be as mentally tough, emotionally secure, and spiritually strong if it wasnt for your love and consistent pouring in to my life.  I also want to thank @tyrsport, @corkcicle, @lyvecap, and @united_re for your support and equipping me to be my best!  Thank you Tokyo, and all of the volunteers for hosting an excellent Olympic Games! We, the athletes and coaches are so grateful.  Lastly, to everybody in my corner. Those of you praying, cheering, and supporting. Thank you for caring and for all of the beautiful messages throughout my career and the Games. I love God, I love my family, I love my country, and I love swimming!  Looking forward to taking some time to surf and celebrate with my friends! Then we start working towards Paris 2024! 1 Corinthians 9:24-27 : @gettysport",

Octopus suckers have something called a chitinous cuticle its kinda like your finger nails, except for octopuses its a protective lining covering the surface of every-single sucker they have!  Just like our fingernails make it easy for us to pick things up, an octopuses textured sucker lining helps them hold onto objects and not let go!  What happens when your nails get too long?  Ya bite em, trim em, or maybe even paint em! When an octopuses sucker lining wears out, it will carefully begin to swirl its 8 arms together until all that's left is hundreds of round translucent sucker discs floating around its den. The outgrown sucker lining sheds off revealing well-manicured squeaky clean suckers! Look at those pearly-whites! And thats not all folks Not only does grooming improve their grip strength, it sharpens their ability to taste and smell with the suckers on their arms! Wild huh?!

With its unearthly glowing colors and silent movements, this gorgeous creature glides through water as if it were weightless. Cuttlefish are masters of the sea with their many superpowers, but one thing that makes them stand out is their unique skirt-like fin. With a muscular fin wrapped around its whole body, the cuttlefish fearlessly moves through water as if they know how skilled they are! (Look at those wise eyes!)  Depending on your angle, the animal appears in any color from shiny greens to blues to match its surroundings- giving them an edge when hiding or hunting prey underwater! When needing to make a quick getaway, cuttlefish morph their tentacles, arms, & body into a sleek looking sports car-like shape and use jet-propulsion to ZOOM backwards at high speeds! The muscular siphon found under their arms is not their mouth but rather its rocket booster they use it to powerfully propel themselves around!  Wonder how they dont bump into anything while jetting backwards at warp speed?Well get thisCuttlefish can squint their W shaped pupils right down the middle and focus on hunting while at the same time watching for predators that might sneak up behind them! Imagine being able to split your pupil into two and being able to see behind yourself!

Shell then turn upside down and cling to the roof of her den to begin the birthing process. Each egg is created in the ovary and then coated with nutrient rich yolk for it to develop in. Sperm is used to fertilize the egg and then the final step is coating the egg with a material that looks like what you can see a translucent rubbery white shell! Mama octos will expel each egg, one by one out of her funnel/siphon, then, using suckers near her beak, painstakingly braid them together into long chains of eggs called festoons. When they reach a certain length (around 175 eggs), Shell produce an adhesive-like secretion at the top of the den to begin another strand or descend to rest & protect her brood    The 30-40 day process involves birthing and braiding 70,000+ eggs and around 400 strands/festoons of eggs.   Mothers meticulously clean and waft currents of water over their eggs so they get a constant supply of fresh, oxygenated water. (Growing eggs require constant influxes of oxygen!)  The hatching off the eggs represents the end of the octopus mothers life as the process of senescence begins. A chemical secretion from her optic gland stops her desire to eat during this process She passes away using the last of her energy to blow the octopus babies into the water column for a better chance of survival!

Females can lay multiple clutches/festoons of eggs vs. dying after brooding one.  its hard to tell the difference between baby wolfi and full grown adult wolfi because theyre miniature versions of the adults!  Theyve got a lifespan of around 6-18 months theyve got little fringes of skin (papillae) on their suckers - probably for better grip strength so they dont blow away (or to capture prey)  Anyway One thing is for sure.

They spend their whole lives floating in the open sea so having a nearly invisible body comes in super handy  If ya look close, the only things visible are their digestive gland, optic nerves & eyes   Glass octopuses keep their bodies vertical  in the water column or spindle shaped Glass octos figured out that if they keep their bodies horizontal their digestive gland casts more of a shadow to predators! Yeah, no thanks! Theyre too smart for all of that  ... The mating process is super unique with this species  normally a male octopus breaks the tip of his specialized arm filled with packets of sperm (called the hectocotylus) and swims off...  Well the male glass octopus arm doesnt break off!  (sounds dangerous if you consider some species of female octopuses will eat the male) The male will completely envelop the female in his webbing making sure that the sperm is released exactly where it needs to go! (I have a picture of the glass octopuses special arm if youre interested in seeing it  DM us )  Ok so then what?  The female glass octopus broods/matures all the eggs inside of her mantle (body) as she navigates the massive open ocean! They hatch directly from her and the cycle begins all over again.

Turns out they dont give it much thought!  Octopus have a unique specialized musculature thats similar to when clams squeeze & lock their shells to protect themselves.   Rather than exerting energy to keep their clam shell shut, the tension is maintained by smooth muscles that fit like a lock and key until a chemical signal (neurotransmitter) releases them.   Scientists believe that octopus skin can catch the look of the landscape they are on & hold the shape effortlessly without any neural input for up to an hour.

The answer is B, but the word \"carcinologist\" calls to mind the word #carcinogens, or things that cause cancer.  That's because cancer the disease IS named for the crab. Supposedly, Hippocrates (of the Hippocratic oath) called cancers \"karkinos,\" the Greek word for crab, perhaps because of the shape it makes when it grows, with spreading projections from a center. Karkinos was later translated into the Latin word for crab, cancer. So now you know why the #astrological sign Cancer is represented by the crab, and why it has that somewhat off-putting name. Carcinization is the process of things evolving into crab-like forms, which happens enough that it needs a word. Many #animals that look just like crabs are not actually part of the official crab family tree, but they have the same hard shell, long legs, and compact bodies (the hermit crab is one example). This is called convergent #evolution: when a trait is so useful it appears and survives more than once in the plant/animal kingdom, in completely unrelated lineages. Bioluminescence is another example. It has appeared at least nine times independently in the plant and animal kingdom (and that's what we know of). #nature #weird #funfacts #crabs #RIPthecommentsection",

They filter the salt out, but that starts a vicious cycle, since the #saltwater draws the fresh water out through their skin and gills via a process called osmosis. So, they have to drink more. Theoretically, if they weren't constantly ingesting and filtering water, they would dehydrate pretty quickly though. ...Aaaand this only applies to fish living in the #ocean; fish living in freshwater are the exact opposite. Because they are \"saltier\" than the water around them, they automatically absorb a lot of this water and have to pee a lot to avoid holding too much. They don't have to drink through their mouths, though. *Only talking about bony fish; #sharks are different.  #science #education #funfacts #marinebiology #marinebio #saltlife",

For example, in 2014, a DARPA researcher weighing roughly 100 kg (200 pounds), carrying a backpack weighing 20 kg (40 lbs), climbed a glass wall using paddles lined with a technology called \"Geckskin.\" Humans creating tech inspired by nature is called #biomimicry and there is a LOT of it coming from the #ocean. *Calm down, it had already died, most likely from the shock of ending up on an oceanic crossing from an archipelago in the mid-Atlantic to northwestern Europe. **OK, here you go: Electrons from the molecules on those tiny gecko hairs and electrons from the wall molecules interact to create an electromagnetic attraction, which, honestly, I couldn't confidently break down for you without literally having to read about the \"four fundamental forces\" that shape our world (a quartet that includes gravity).

How do you tell the difference between a ship and a boat? - The general rule of thumb: you can put a boat on a ship, but you can't put a ship on a boat. - Weighs at least 500 tons - Is capable of crossing the open ocean. For example, large carrier boats on the Great Lakes or paddlewheelers on freshwater rivers, despite being ship-sized, are boats since they never enter the ocean.* - Ships have permanent crew with a commanding officer These are general guidelines--there are still exceptions. Submersibles, even when they're really big, are generally referred to as boats, and even though Commercial fishing vessels can be really big and operate on the high seas, they're still commonly referred to as boats. *Thanks to TikTok commenter Andrew Harrison for the info. : #OceanXplorer by @jpegphotos",

Only the males have that one big claw, and you know what they say about the size of the claw? Thats right: all the better for digging holes, which they live in. The other purpose for the claw is the waving ritual. Basically a male fiddler #crab stands there and waves his big claw around until a female takes notice. (Look at this claw! Look at the amazing burrow I can dig us!) The one problem is that bigger claws are actually less good for fighting. So, crabs with smaller claws might not have as much to work with in the waving ritual, but they can beat up the other crabs and steal their burrows. Which one would you rather be? Also: when a male loses his big claw in a fight, his small claw will grow big to compensate and the missing claw will grow back small. Isnt that weird? That means the big claw is on different sides for fiddler crabs, depending on how scrappy their lives have been. For size reference, the largest fiddler crabs are only about five centimers (two inches) across.

One of these little fish's ancestors was discovered recently on a #fossil site in the Egyptian desert. It turns out this and other #species survived the Paleocene-Eocene (1), a 200,000-year-long period where massive carbon outputs* warmed the climate by between 5-8 degrees Celsius (9-14 degrees Fahrenheit). They don't know enough about what conditions were like in the regionwhether, for example, there was an upwelling of cool water mitigating the local water temperature, or whether these #species were more heat tolerant than their descendants.  \"The survival of one group in isolation shouldn't be taken as evidence that changing climates are something to brush off,\" said one of the study's authors, Matt Friedman. The Paleocene-Eocene is widely considered an imperfect but the closest analogy to our current warming climate.** *Likely from volcanos, among other hypotheses. **While there are always people in our comments like \"wEll TEh EaRtH tempArAToor hAS alWayS beEN chAngINg,\" like, no duh, but the difference is that current carbon dioxide emissions are around 10 times the rate that led to the Paleo Eocene Thermal Maximum. Also, that temperature increase happened over thousands of years, whereas current #emissions scenarios suggest we'll hit half of that in a few centuries, giving organisms waaaay less time to adapt.

Our fore fathers knew our rights came from God, not man, not a President, not a senator, not a congressman. They knew He was in charge.

Also, parents are attending school board meetings and speaking out about this new so called sex education class. My wife and I will be the only ones to teach our kids about the spiritual act of sex, not tv, not movies, not music, no part of culture today, and definitely not a school.

Its not easy to use when the wind is blowing, its a ton of work. Its made for seeing smallmouth on there beds which are usually in 6-12 foot. It works so good on the St Lawrence and Great Lakes bc 1. Water is gin clear 2. Smallmouth are not nearly as spookie , you can literally have your boat over the top of them when bed fishing 3. Cuts glare off water so you can see if the bait is on the bed which is super hard to do if its deep. It was a lot of fun this past week, finished 15th. Thanks Flogger!!",

Animal fact- Crabs interact with each other and are often found in large groups. Marine hermit crabs live in the ocean and land hermit crabs live primarily on land. The hermit crab is not like other crabs. The hermit crabs abdomen does not have a hard covering. To protect the abdomen, a hermit crab inhabits an empty snail shell. The shell also stores water for the crab. Hermit crabs have gills that need to remain moist in order for them to breath. - - - Follow us @amazing.sea.world for more !!  - - Credit : : DM for credit  -  - #shark #sharks #sharkweek #sharktank #sharkattack #sharknado #sharkbait #greatwhiteshark #sharktooth #sharkfishing #sharkie #sharky #savesharks #sharkdiving #sharkteeth #sharklife #sharkbite #sharktattoo #sharkies #sharkeez #tigershark #sharkconservation #whalesharks.",

That is until she realized she was a PHENOMENAL track star, the track coach at Gardner-Webb saw this and offered her a spot on the track team. She decided then to switch from basketball TO RUN TRACK AT A D1 UNIVERSITY!  In college she placed 3rd in the heptathlon and 4x400 at the conference championships. She went on to complete her bachelors in 4 years and did a 5th year to get her masters CHAMP  Without taking a gap year she went straight into Med School at Auburn University. While attending med school she played a lot and I mean a lot of frisbee. She found a semi pro team in her area that held open tryouts. No surprise she made the team. At that point she was in her 3rd year of med school and a semi pro athlete. Fast forward to now and she has graduated!  She is officially a Doctor of Medicine and will be attending her residency at UCLA for Physical Medicine and Rehab. ",

These fish are a member of the angler fish family, deep sea creatures that call the waters 3000ft below the surface of the ocean their home. Only females possess the long stalk on the head, which has a bioluminescent tip used as a lure to entice prey in the darkness of the water, devoid of sunlight.  Their teeth, like pointed shards of glass, are transparent and their large mouth is capable of sucking up and swallowing prey the size of their own body. While females can reach lengths of 24 inches males only grow to be about an inch long and their sole purpose is to find a female and help her reproduce.  Males latch onto the female with their teeth and become sexual parasites, losing their eyes, internal organs, and everything else but the testes. The male becomes a permanent appendage that draws nutrition from its female host and serves as an easily accessible source of sperm.  To see an actual angler fish intact is very rare and it is unknown how or why the fish ended up on the shore. Seeing this strange and fascinating fish is a testament to the diversity of marine life lurking below the waters surface in Californias Marine Protected Areas.

While usually it takes us six exits to decide where to fill up our car, BPme Price Match is a GAME CHANGER. (AD)   I downloaded the app, subscribed for 99 cents and, now, I have a price match guarantee on gas prices from any station within a half mile.   I've been doing price matching for more than a decade -- before there were even apps for it. My mom and I would keep track of the lowest prices and text each other whenever we found something better. Trust me, the BPme app is way easier. Find a bp or Amoco station, fill up and save! @bp_plc   Swipe to look through photos from my trip, and click the link in my bio to download the app!",

I wanted to write few words and acknowledge this wonderful piece of art whose author is unknown (at least to me). When I first saw this picture I was emotional. It brought me back to childhood and my first tennis steps. When I was a kid, I was constructing Wimbledon trophy out of improvised material I could find in my room. I was looking myself in the mirror, saying I am Novak Djokovic, Wimbledon champion. To win this sacred and most special tournament for me for 6th time is surreal. I am blessed and grateful to experience many beautiful moments on the holy grass of Wimbledon. My imagination was very realistic. As every kid, I dreamed,imagined,visualized and believed 100% in my dreams, like they were already achieved. Imagination and visualization is a super power.When children dream and imagine,its the purest form of love and motivation. I was fortunate that I had parents and few more other close people in my career that allowed me to dream and believe I can reach the stars in tennis. I am not saying that everyone will succeed in reaching the biggest heights in tennis. As a parent I believe creating loving and caring environment where we as parents show respect and support for childrens dreams,can do many wonders for our society and sports ecosystem as a whole    ,       .                        .              .               .               .       ,   ,          . /         .                         , ,   .

Any role I can play in helping my boyhood club Im going to do it. Even to my detriment at times. Having been out of the game recovering from the double stress fracture, and having spent a lot of time away from teammates and staff whod been a part of my life for as long as I could remember, I needed to feel a part of something again. I needed to feel like I was playing my part. Ive read some call me selfish for holding off getting the surgery this season but it was never about putting myself first and thats how weve reached this point, and something as a 23 year old Ive had to learn the hard way. To guarantee I can play this game as long as possible I need to listen to my body. Everyone has an opinion but no one knows my body better than me. Its hard to describe the feeling of representing your country. Given the choice no one would ever turn that down at such a big tournament. As a little boy or girl you dream of those moments. I had been deemed fit for the full season, and given my injuries were being managed, what was another couple of weeks? Managing the pain I was training well and found a lot of comfort in the England camp after the Europa League final. On hindsight, if I had of known I wouldnt have played a significant role in the Euros, would I have gone? Hindsight is a wonderful thing isnt it I didnt want to let anyone down but ultimately looking at some of my performances towards the end of last season I felt like I was. When I step on the pitch I always give 100%. Physically my 100% just wasnt possible. Im walking away from last season with 36 goal contributions, but more importantly Im walking away with lessons learnt. We live and we learn as they say but what is never in doubt is my commitment to the club and the national team. Its been a hard one but Im coming back physically and mentally stronger. Thank you for all of the kind messages. ",

Ive had a difficult season, I think thats been clear for everyone to see and I probably went into that final with a lack of confidence. Ive always backed myself for a penalty but something didnt feel quite right. During the long run up I was saving myself a bit of time and unfortunately the result was not what I wanted. I felt as though I had let my teammates down. I felt as if Id let everyone down. A penalty was all Id been asked to contribute for the team. I can score penalties in my sleep so why not that one? Its been playing in my head over and over since I struck the ball and theres probably not a word to quite describe how it feels. Final. 55 years. 1 penalty. History. All I can say is sorry. I wish it had of gone differently. Whilst I continue to say sorry I want to shoutout my teammates. This summer has been one of the best camps Ive experienced and youve all played a role in that. A brotherhood has been built that is unbreakable. Your success is my success. Your failures are mine. Ive grown into a sport where I expect to read things written about myself. Whether it be the colour of my skin, where I grew up, or, most recently, how I decide to spend my time off the pitch. I can take critique of my performance all day long, my penalty was not good enough, it should have gone in but I will never apologise for who I am and where I came from. Ive felt no prouder moment than wearing those three lions on my chest and seeing my family cheer me on in a crowd of 10s of thousands. I dreamt of days like this. The messages Ive received today have been positively overwhelming and seeing the response in Withington had me on the verge of tears. The communities that always wrapped their arms around me continue to hold me up. Im Marcus Rashford, 23 year old, black man from Withington and Wythenshawe, South Manchester. If I have nothing else I have that.  For all the kind messages, thank you. Ill be back stronger. Well be back stronger.  MR10",

As temperatures have soared and strong winds stoked the flames the past 3 days, killing at least 4 people along with 1,000+ farm animals and sending 60 more people to the hospital as their homes burned down. So far 18 villages have been evacuated and 35 aircrafts, 457 vehicles, and 4,000 personnel have been involved in the firefighting efforts, as separate wildfires raged in the provinces of Osmaniye, Kayseri, Kocaeli, Adana, Mersin and Kutahya. Turkey has battled a series of disasters caused by extreme weather conditions this summer, including flash floods last week that killed 6 people in the Black Sea region so please join us in praying for all the people and animals in these hard hit communities along with the brave firefighters and share this with your followers and friends  Via @karmagawa  #prayforturkey #wildfires #turkey",

Since Ive had a lot of fun sharing our life story in short highlight videos Ive perhaps given the unintended impression that its all been rainbows and kisses, and that marrying your first love is always a romantic and excellent idea. I regularly get messages from young people asking for relationship advice because they want what we have. So here are some of my personal truths and observations. Being right for each other is way more important than how old you are. If we hadnt met at such a young age I would rather have waited for him than commit to the wrong person. True love is worth waiting for. Part of true love is treating each other with the care and respect you both deserve. If you dont believe you deserve those things then take some time to fall in love with yourself first so you give off a vibe that attracts someone who agrees with you. Dont think you can change the wrong person into the right person. People can and do change, but only if they want to for their own reasons, not because someone else sees them as a fixer-upper. If youre going to commit to someone accept their imperfections too youre getting the whole package. Just as there are no perfect people there is no perfect marriage. Everyone struggles at times. Nobody owes anybody the painful parts of their story just know that everybody has them. Continued in comments...",

Annie Lazor came out of retirement years ago, battled constant injury, and persevered through personal tragedy now shes an Olympic Medalist. Im lucky to have friends like them. They inspire me. And finally Huge congratulations to Tatjana on setting a New World Record. Incredible swim. Youve all inspired the world. #Champions #Tokyo2020 #Swimming",

Too blessed to stress, and God is so good!  I have been working toward this dream with my family for the last 12 years. To my mom and dad, I would not be the Olympian I am today without you. Thank you for sacrificing everything to give me this incredible opportunity to display Gods gifts. To my sister Michaela, youre my best friend and youve seen me at my best and at my worst. I wouldnt be as mentally tough, emotionally secure, and spiritually strong if it wasnt for your love and consistent pouring in to my life.  I also want to thank @tyrsport, @corkcicle, @lyvecap, and @united_re for your support and equipping me to be my best!  Thank you Tokyo, and all of the volunteers for hosting an excellent Olympic Games! We, the athletes and coaches are so grateful.  Lastly, to everybody in my corner. Those of you praying, cheering, and supporting. Thank you for caring and for all of the beautiful messages throughout my career and the Games. I love God, I love my family, I love my country, and I love swimming!  Looking forward to taking some time to surf and celebrate with my friends!

Octopus suckers have something called a chitinous cuticle its kinda like your finger nails, except for octopuses its a protective lining covering the surface of every-single sucker they have!  Just like our fingernails make it easy for us to pick things up, an octopuses textured sucker lining helps them hold onto objects and not let go!  What happens when your nails get too long?  Ya bite em, trim em, or maybe even paint em! When an octopuses sucker lining wears out, it will carefully begin to swirl its 8 arms together until all that's left is hundreds of round translucent sucker discs floating around its den. The outgrown sucker lining sheds off revealing well-manicured squeaky clean suckers! Look at those pearly-whites! And thats not all folks Not only does grooming improve their grip strength, it sharpens their ability to taste and smell with the suckers on their arms! Wild huh?!

With its unearthly glowing colors and silent movements, this gorgeous creature glides through water as if it were weightless. Cuttlefish are masters of the sea with their many superpowers, but one thing that makes them stand out is their unique skirt-like fin. With a muscular fin wrapped around its whole body, the cuttlefish fearlessly moves through water as if they know how skilled they are! (Look at those wise eyes!)  Depending on your angle, the animal appears in any color from shiny greens to blues to match its surroundings- giving them an edge when hiding or hunting prey underwater! When needing to make a quick getaway, cuttlefish morph their tentacles, arms, & body into a sleek looking sports car-like shape and use jet-propulsion to ZOOM backwards at high speeds! The muscular siphon found under their arms is not their mouth but rather its rocket booster they use it to powerfully propel themselves around!  Wonder how they dont bump into anything while jetting backwards at warp speed?Well get thisCuttlefish can squint their W shaped pupils right down the middle and focus on hunting while at the same time watching for predators that might sneak up behind them!

Shell then turn upside down and cling to the roof of her den to begin the birthing process. Each egg is created in the ovary and then coated with nutrient rich yolk for it to develop in. Sperm is used to fertilize the egg and then the final step is coating the egg with a material that looks like what you can see a translucent rubbery white shell! Mama octos will expel each egg, one by one out of her funnel/siphon, then, using suckers near her beak, painstakingly braid them together into long chains of eggs called festoons. When they reach a certain length (around 175 eggs), Shell produce an adhesive-like secretion at the top of the den to begin another strand or descend to rest & protect her brood    The 30-40 day process involves birthing and braiding 70,000+ eggs and around 400 strands/festoons of eggs.   Mothers meticulously clean and waft currents of water over their eggs so they get a constant supply of fresh, oxygenated water. (Growing eggs require constant influxes of oxygen!)  The hatching off the eggs represents the end of the octopus mothers life as the process of senescence begins. A chemical secretion from her optic gland stops her desire to eat during this process She passes away using the last of her energy to blow the octopus babies into the water column for a better chance of survival!  We love our selfless octopus mothers!  If ya read this far, what did you find most fascinating above? Learn anything? Have anymore questions?  Its wild to me personally that they have this preprogrammed innate ability to begin this process - how do they know how long to make the strands?

Yeah, no thanks! Theyre too smart for all of that  ... The mating process is super unique with this species  normally a male octopus breaks the tip of his specialized arm filled with packets of sperm (called the hectocotylus) and swims off...  Well the male glass octopus arm doesnt break off!  (sounds dangerous if you consider some species of female octopuses will eat the male) The male will completely envelop the female in his webbing making sure that the sperm is released exactly where it needs to go! (I have a picture of the glass octopuses special arm if youre interested in seeing it  DM us )  Ok so then what?  The female glass octopus broods/matures all the eggs inside of her mantle (body) as she navigates the massive open ocean! They hatch directly from her and the cycle begins all over again.

Turns out they dont give it much thought!  Octopus have a unique specialized musculature thats similar to when clams squeeze & lock their shells to protect themselves.   Rather than exerting energy to keep their clam shell shut, the tension is maintained by smooth muscles that fit like a lock and key until a chemical signal (neurotransmitter) releases them.   Scientists believe that octopus skin can catch the look of the landscape they are on & hold the shape effortlessly without any neural input for up to an hour.

The answer is B, but the word \"carcinologist\" calls to mind the word #carcinogens, or things that cause cancer.  That's because cancer the disease IS named for the crab. Supposedly, Hippocrates (of the Hippocratic oath) called cancers \"karkinos,\" the Greek word for crab, perhaps because of the shape it makes when it grows, with spreading projections from a center. Karkinos was later translated into the Latin word for crab, cancer. So now you know why the #astrological sign Cancer is represented by the crab, and why it has that somewhat off-putting name. Carcinization is the process of things evolving into crab-like forms, which happens enough that it needs a word. Many #animals that look just like crabs are not actually part of the official crab family tree, but they have the same hard shell, long legs, and compact bodies (the hermit crab is one example). This is called convergent #evolution: when a trait is so useful it appears and survives more than once in the plant/animal kingdom, in completely unrelated lineages. Bioluminescence is another example. It has appeared at least nine times independently in the plant and animal kingdom (and that's what we know of). #nature #weird #funfacts #crabs #RIPthecommentsection",

They filter the salt out, but that starts a vicious cycle, since the #saltwater draws the fresh water out through their skin and gills via a process called osmosis. So, they have to drink more. Theoretically, if they weren't constantly ingesting and filtering water, they would dehydrate pretty quickly though. ...Aaaand this only applies to fish living in the #ocean; fish living in freshwater are the exact opposite. Because they are \"saltier\" than the water around them, they automatically absorb a lot of this water and have to pee a lot to avoid holding too much.

How do you tell the difference between a ship and a boat? - The general rule of thumb: you can put a boat on a ship, but you can't put a ship on a boat. - Weighs at least 500 tons - Is capable of crossing the open ocean. For example, large carrier boats on the Great Lakes or paddlewheelers on freshwater rivers, despite being ship-sized, are boats since they never enter the ocean.* - Ships have permanent crew with a commanding officer These are general guidelines--there are still exceptions. Submersibles, even when they're really big, are generally referred to as boats, and even though Commercial fishing vessels can be really big and operate on the high seas, they're still commonly referred to as boats. *Thanks to TikTok commenter Andrew Harrison for the info. : #OceanXplorer by @jpegphotos",

Only the males have that one big claw, and you know what they say about the size of the claw? Thats right: all the better for digging holes, which they live in. The other purpose for the claw is the waving ritual. Basically a male fiddler #crab stands there and waves his big claw around until a female takes notice. (Look at this claw! Look at the amazing burrow I can dig us!) The one problem is that bigger claws are actually less good for fighting. So, crabs with smaller claws might not have as much to work with in the waving ritual, but they can beat up the other crabs and steal their burrows. Which one would you rather be? Also: when a male loses his big claw in a fight, his small claw will grow big to compensate and the missing claw will grow back small. Isnt that weird? That means the big claw is on different sides for fiddler crabs, depending on how scrappy their lives have been. For size reference, the largest fiddler crabs are only about five centimers (two inches) across.

I believe we are blessed because our fore fathers got it right when they wrote in our Declaration of Independence We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights, that among these are Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness. Our fore fathers knew our rights came from God, not man, not a President, not a senator, not a congressman. They knew He was in charge. God has been there for us in all times of struggle and pain in this Nation and has pulled us through. I have no doubt that it is because of the Faithful men and women of America that God has put His hand on this Nation and blessed us beyond measure. America is a beacon of hope all over the globe. People are dying to get into America. The media might tell you differently but people are dying to come here because we are the freest greatest Nation in the World. I hope today you celebrate like never before and always remember the courageous who came before you and paid the ultimate sacrifice for us to be free. Dont hide it, dont shy away from it. Celebrate it, stand up and speak up and share it with everyone. Lets fight for the cause of Freedom. God bless you and your family on this Independence Day!! #july4th #independenceday #usa #America #forefathers #blessedNation #Godisgood",

Water is gin clear 2. Smallmouth are not nearly as spookie , you can literally have your boat over the top of them when bed fishing 3. Cuts glare off water so you can see if the bait is on the bed which is super hard to do if its deep. It was a lot of fun this past week, finished 15th. Thanks Flogger!!",

Animal fact- Crabs interact with each other and are often found in large groups. Marine hermit crabs live in the ocean and land hermit crabs live primarily on land. The hermit crab is not like other crabs. The hermit crabs abdomen does not have a hard covering. To protect the abdomen, a hermit crab inhabits an empty snail shell. The shell also stores water for the crab. Hermit crabs have gills that need to remain moist in order for them to breath. - - - Follow us @amazing.sea.world for more !!  - - Credit : : DM for credit  -  - #shark #sharks #sharkweek #sharktank #sharkattack #sharknado #sharkbait #greatwhiteshark #sharktooth #sharkfishing #sharkie #sharky #savesharks #sharkdiving #sharkteeth #sharklife #sharkbite #sharktattoo #sharkies #sharkeez #tigershark #sharkconservation #whalesharks.",

That is until she realized she was a PHENOMENAL track star, the track coach at Gardner-Webb saw this and offered her a spot on the track team. She decided then to switch from basketball TO RUN TRACK AT A D1 UNIVERSITY!  In college she placed 3rd in the heptathlon and 4x400 at the conference championships. She went on to complete her bachelors in 4 years and did a 5th year to get her masters CHAMP  Without taking a gap year she went straight into Med School at Auburn University. While attending med school she played a lot and I mean a lot of frisbee. She found a semi pro team in her area that held open tryouts. No surprise she made the team. At that point she was in her 3rd year of med school and a semi pro athlete. Fast forward to now and she has graduated!  She is officially a Doctor of Medicine and will be attending her residency at UCLA for Physical Medicine and Rehab. ",

These fish are a member of the angler fish family, deep sea creatures that call the waters 3000ft below the surface of the ocean their home. Only females possess the long stalk on the head, which has a bioluminescent tip used as a lure to entice prey in the darkness of the water, devoid of sunlight.  Their teeth, like pointed shards of glass, are transparent and their large mouth is capable of sucking up and swallowing prey the size of their own body. While females can reach lengths of 24 inches males only grow to be about an inch long and their sole purpose is to find a female and help her reproduce.  Males latch onto the female with their teeth and become sexual parasites, losing their eyes, internal organs, and everything else but the testes. The male becomes a permanent appendage that draws nutrition from its female host and serves as an easily accessible source of sperm.  To see an actual angler fish intact is very rare and it is unknown how or why the fish ended up on the shore. Seeing this strange and fascinating fish is a testament to the diversity of marine life lurking below the waters surface in Californias Marine Protected Areas.

I wanted to write few words and acknowledge this wonderful piece of art whose author is unknown (at least to me). When I first saw this picture I was emotional. It brought me back to childhood and my first tennis steps. When I was a kid, I was constructing Wimbledon trophy out of improvised material I could find in my room. I was looking myself in the mirror, saying I am Novak Djokovic, Wimbledon champion. To win this sacred and most special tournament for me for 6th time is surreal. I am blessed and grateful to experience many beautiful moments on the holy grass of Wimbledon. My imagination was very realistic. As every kid, I dreamed,imagined,visualized and believed 100% in my dreams, like they were already achieved. Imagination and visualization is a super power.When children dream and imagine,its the purest form of love and motivation. I was fortunate that I had parents and few more other close people in my career that allowed me to dream and believe I can reach the stars in tennis. I am not saying that everyone will succeed in reaching the biggest heights in tennis. As a parent I believe creating loving and caring environment where we as parents show respect and support for childrens dreams,can do many wonders for our society and sports ecosystem as a whole    ,       .                        .              .               .               .       ,   ,          . /         .                         , ,   .

Any role I can play in helping my boyhood club Im going to do it. Even to my detriment at times. Having been out of the game recovering from the double stress fracture, and having spent a lot of time away from teammates and staff whod been a part of my life for as long as I could remember, I needed to feel a part of something again. I needed to feel like I was playing my part. Ive read some call me selfish for holding off getting the surgery this season but it was never about putting myself first and thats how weve reached this point, and something as a 23 year old Ive had to learn the hard way. To guarantee I can play this game as long as possible I need to listen to my body. Everyone has an opinion but no one knows my body better than me. Its hard to describe the feeling of representing your country. Given the choice no one would ever turn that down at such a big tournament. As a little boy or girl you dream of those moments. I had been deemed fit for the full season, and given my injuries were being managed, what was another couple of weeks? Managing the pain I was training well and found a lot of comfort in the England camp after the Europa League final. On hindsight, if I had of known I wouldnt have played a significant role in the Euros, would I have gone? Hindsight is a wonderful thing isnt it I didnt want to let anyone down but ultimately looking at some of my performances towards the end of last season I felt like I was. When I step on the pitch I always give 100%. Physically my 100% just wasnt possible. Im walking away from last season with 36 goal contributions, but more importantly Im walking away with lessons learnt. We live and we learn as they say but what is never in doubt is my commitment to the club and the national team. Its been a hard one but Im coming back physically and mentally stronger. Thank you for all of the kind messages. ",

Ive had a difficult season, I think thats been clear for everyone to see and I probably went into that final with a lack of confidence. Ive always backed myself for a penalty but something didnt feel quite right. During the long run up I was saving myself a bit of time and unfortunately the result was not what I wanted. I felt as though I had let my teammates down. I felt as if Id let everyone down. A penalty was all Id been asked to contribute for the team. I can score penalties in my sleep so why not that one? Its been playing in my head over and over since I struck the ball and theres probably not a word to quite describe how it feels. Final. 55 years. 1 penalty. History. All I can say is sorry. I wish it had of gone differently. Whilst I continue to say sorry I want to shoutout my teammates. This summer has been one of the best camps Ive experienced and youve all played a role in that. A brotherhood has been built that is unbreakable. Your success is my success. Your failures are mine. Ive grown into a sport where I expect to read things written about myself. Whether it be the colour of my skin, where I grew up, or, most recently, how I decide to spend my time off the pitch. I can take critique of my performance all day long, my penalty was not good enough, it should have gone in but I will never apologise for who I am and where I came from. Ive felt no prouder moment than wearing those three lions on my chest and seeing my family cheer me on in a crowd of 10s of thousands. I dreamt of days like this. The messages Ive received today have been positively overwhelming and seeing the response in Withington had me on the verge of tears. The communities that always wrapped their arms around me continue to hold me up. Im Marcus Rashford, 23 year old, black man from Withington and Wythenshawe, South Manchester. If I have nothing else I have that.  For all the kind messages, thank you. Ill be back stronger. Well be back stronger.  MR10",

All those names and weights on the wall in the back are middle school, high school and college kids, moms and dads, young and old. theyre people who push themselves, put in the work and strive to improve every single day.

But its been absolutely darling to see people getting their Sharkpups and hearing of friends and family excited with their gifts and made all that work worth it! If you helped back the Kickstarter thank you so much for your contribution and excitement to these little guys  Fulfillment is finally wrapped up and everyones Sharkpups are heading home. . And if you only found me recently and missed out on tbe campaign, do not fear! I still have Sharkpups left and will be opening my shop for sale on August 13th! . Thanks again for your support guys!

Tbh I wasn't quite sure with this one  Also I'm sorry for saying I had everyone from class 1a when I was still missing Mr sparkle boy here  . Do you have a tattoo? Well, these 2 now have some^^  . Headcanon: Aoyama and Denki were the only ones excepting Mineta throughout his 2nd and 3rd year of highschool. Despite him really trying and looking his best. In his 3rd year he started to distance himself from Denki a bit though. He realized Denki would always be seen as that charming a little per<y character he introduced himself as, while mineta never had his charm. . Later he wanted to keep things low first and learn how other pro heroes around him behaved to be excepted from the public. So he became a side kick first (Not Aoyamas btw tough. But working for the same agency) . Aoyama is so much fun to draw  I hope I get to draw him more in the future  .
